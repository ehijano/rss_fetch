      <title>Towards Achieving Cooperation Compliance of Human Drivers in Mixed Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a mixed-traffic environment in transportation systems, where Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) coexist with potentially non-cooperative Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs). We develop a cooperation compliance control framework to incentivize HDVs to align their behavior with socially optimal objectives using a ``refundable toll'' scheme so as to achieve a desired compliance probability for all non-compliant HDVs through a feedback control mechanism combining global with local (individual) components. We apply this scheme to the lane-changing problem, where a ``Social Planner'' provides references to the HDVs, measures their state errors, and induces cooperation compliance for safe lane-changing through a refundable toll approach. Simulation results are included to show the effectiveness of our cooperation compliance controller in terms of improved compliance and lane-changing maneuver safety and efficiency when non-cooperative HDVs are present.</description>

      <title>A Mobility Equity Metric for Multi-Modal Intelligent Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a metric to evaluate the equity in mobility and a routing framework to enhance the metric within multi-modal intelligent transportation systems. The mobility equity metric (MEM) simultaneously accounts for service accessibility and transportation costs to quantify the equity and fairness in a transportation network. Finally, we develop a system planner integrated with MEM that aims to distribute travel demand for the transportation network, resulting in a socially optimal mobility system. Our framework results in a transportation network that is efficient in terms of travel time, improves accessibility, and ensures equity in transportation.</description>

      <title>Design of a Rectangular Linear Microstrip Patch Antenna Array for 5G Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and characterization of a rectangular microstrip patch antenna array optimized for operation within the Ku-band frequency range. The antenna array is impedance-matched to 50 Ohms and utilizes a microstrip line feeding mechanism for excitation. The design maintains compact dimensions, with the overall antenna occupying an area of 29.5x7 mm. The antenna structure is modelled on an R03003 substrate material, featuring a dielectric constant of 3, a low-loss tangent of 0.0009, and a thickness of 1.574 mm. The substrate is backed by a conducting ground plane, and the array consists of six radiating patch elements positioned on top. Evaluation of the designed antenna array reveals a resonant frequency of 18GHz, with a -10 dB impedance bandwidth extending over 700MHz. The antenna demonstrates a high gain of 7.51dBi, making it well-suited for applications in 5G and future communication systems. Its compact form factor, cost-effectiveness, and broad impedance and radiation coverage further underscore its potential in these domains.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Personalized Energy Consumption Range Estimation for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles in Urban Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In urban traffic environments, driver behaviors exhibit considerable diversity in vehicle operation, encompassing a range of acceleration and braking maneuvers as well as adherence to traffic regulations, such as speed limits. It is well-established that these intrinsic driving behaviors significantly influence vehicle energy consumption. Therefore, establishing a quantitative relationship between driver behavior and energy usage is essential for identifying energy-efficient driving practices and optimizing routes within urban traffic. This study introduces a data-driven approach to predict the equivalent fuel consumption of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) based on an integrated model of driver behavior and vehicle energy consumption. Unlike traditional models that provide point predictions of fuel consumption, this approach uses Conformalized Quantile Regression (CQR) to offer prediction intervals that capture the variability and uncertainty in fuel consumption. These intervals reflect changes in fuel consumption, as well as variations in driver behavior, and vehicle and route conditions. To develop this model, driver-specific data were collected through a driver-in-the-loop simulator, which tested different human drivers responses. The CQR model was then trained and validated using the experimental data from the driver-in-the-loop simulator, augmented by the synthetic data generated from Monte Carlo simulations conducted using a calibrated microscopic driver behavior and vehicle energy model. The CQR model was evaluated by comparing its predictions of equivalent fuel consumption intervals with those of baseline prediction interval methods that rely solely on conformal prediction.</description>

      <title>A Two-sided Model for EV Market Dynamics and Policy Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusion of Electric Vehicles (EVs) plays a pivotal role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in the U.S., where ambitious zero-emission and carbon neutrality objectives have been set. In pursuit of these goals, many states have implemented a range of incentive policies aimed at stimulating EV adoption and charging infrastructure development, especially public EV charging stations (EVCS). This study examines the indirect network effect observed between EV adoption and EVCS deployment within urban landscapes. We developed a two-sided log-log regression model with historical data on EV purchases and EVCS development to quantify this effect. To test the robustness, we then conducted a case study of the EV market in Los Angeles (LA) County, which suggests that a 1% increase in EVCS correlates with a 0.35% increase in EV sales. Additionally, we forecasted the future EV market dynamics in LA County, revealing a notable disparity between current policies and the targeted 80% EV market share for private cars by 2045. To bridge this gap, we proposed a combined policy recommendation that enhances EV incentives by 60% and EVCS rebates by 66%, facilitating the achievement of future EV market objectives.</description>

      <title>Regression Equilibrium in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renewable power producers participating in electricity markets build forecasting models independently, relying on their own data, model and feature preferences. In this paper, we argue that in renewable-dominated markets, such an uncoordinated approach to forecasting results in substantial opportunity costs for stochastic producers and additional operating costs for the power system. As a solution, we introduce Regression Equilibrium--a welfare-optimal state of electricity markets under uncertainty, where profit-seeking stochastic producers do not benefit by unilaterally deviating from their equilibrium forecast models. While the regression equilibrium maximizes the private welfare, i.e., the average profit of stochastic producers across the day-ahead and real-time markets, it also aligns with the socially optimal, least-cost dispatch solution for the system. We base the equilibrium analysis on the theory of variational inequalities, providing results on the existence and uniqueness of regression equilibrium in energy-only markets. We also devise two methods for computing the regression equilibrium: centralized optimization and a decentralized ADMM-based algorithm that preserves the privacy of regression datasets.</description>

      <title>Differential Voltage Analysis and Patterns in Parallel-Connected Pairs of Imbalanced Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnosing imbalances in capacity and resistance within parallel-connected cells in battery packs is critical for battery management and fault detection, but it is challenging given that individual currents flowing into each cell are often unmeasured. This work introduces a novel method useful for identifying imbalances in capacity and resistance within a pair of parallel-connected cells using only voltage and current measurements from the pair. Our method utilizes differential voltage analysis (DVA) when the pair is under constant current discharge and demonstrates that features of the pair's differential voltage curve (dV/dQ), namely its mid-to-high SOC dV/dQ peak's height and skewness, are sensitive to imbalances in capacity and resistance. We analyze and explain how and why these dV/dQ peak shape features change in response to these imbalances, highlighting that the underlying current imbalance dynamics resulting from these imbalances contribute to these changes. Ultimately, we demonstrate that dV/dQ peak shape features can identify the product of capacity imbalance and resistance imbalance, but cannot uniquely identify the imbalances. This work lays the groundwork for identifying imbalances in capacity and resistance in parallel-connected cell groups in battery packs, where commonly only a single current sensor is placed for each parallel cell group.</description>

      <title>A Passive and Asynchronous Wake-up Receiver for Acoustic Underwater Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing reliable data exchange in an underwater domain using energy and power-efficient communication methods is crucial and challenging. Radio frequencies are absorbed by the salty and mineral-rich water and optical signals are obstructed and scattered after short distances. In contrast, acoustic communication benefits from low absorption and enables communication over long distances. Underwater communication must match low power and energy requirements as underwater sensor systems must have a long battery lifetime and need to work reliably due to their deployment and maintenance cost. For long-term deployments, the sensors' overall power consumption is determined by the power consumption during idle state. It can be reduced by integrating asynchronous always-on wake-up circuits with nano-watt power consumption. However, this approach does reduce but not eliminate idle power consumption, leaving a margin for improvement. This paper presents a passive and asynchronous wake-up receiver for acoustic underwater communication enabling zero-power always-on listening. Zero-power listening is achieved by combining energy and information transmission using a low-power wake-up receiver that extracts energy out of the acoustic signal and eliminates radio frontend idle consumption. In-field evaluations demonstrate that the wake-up circuit requires only 63 uW to detect and compare an 8-bit UUID at a data rate of 200 bps up to a distance of 5 m and that the needed energy can directly be extracted from the acoustic signal.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Controlling Many-Core HPC Processors: an Alternative to PID and Moving Average Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The race towards performance increase and computing power has led to chips with heterogeneous and complex designs, integrating an ever-growing number of cores on the same monolithic chip or chiplet silicon die. Higher integration density, compounded with the slowdown of technology-driven power reduction, implies that power and thermal management become increasingly relevant. Unfortunately, existing research lacks a detailed analysis and modeling of thermal, power, and electrical coupling effects and how they have to be jointly considered to perform dynamic control of complex and heterogeneous Multi-Processor System on Chips (MPSoCs). To close the gap, in this work, we first provide a detailed thermal and power model targeting a modern High Performance Computing (HPC) MPSoC. We consider real-world coupling effects such as actuators' non-idealities and the exponential relation between the dissipated power, the temperature state, and the voltage level in a single processing element. We analyze how these factors affect the control algorithm behavior and the type of challenges that they pose. Based on the analysis, we propose a thermal capping strategy inspired by Fuzzy control theory to replace the state-of-the-art PID controller, as well as a root-finding iterative method to optimally choose the shared voltage value among cores grouped in the same voltage domain. We evaluate the proposed controller with model-in-the-loop and hardware-in-the-loop co-simulations. We show an improvement over state-of-the-art methods of up to 5x the maximum exceeded temperature while providing an average of 3.56% faster application execution runtime across all the evaluation scenarios.</description>

      <title>A blended physics-based and black-box identification approach for spacecraft inertia estimation -- EXTENDED VERSION</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of identifying inertial characteristics of a generic space vehicle relying on the physical and structural insights of the dynamical system is presented. To this aim, we exploit a recently introduced framework for the identification of physical parameters directly feeding the measurements into a backpropagation-like learning algorithm. In particular, this paper extends this approach by introducing a recursive algorithm that combines physics-based and black-box techniques to enhance accuracy and reliability in estimating spacecraft inertia. We demonstrate through numerical results that, relying on the derived algorithm to identify the inertia tensor of a nanosatellite, we can achieve improved estimation accuracy and robustness, by integrating physical constraints and leveraging partial knowledge of the system dynamics. In particular, we show how it is possible to enhance the convergence of the physics-based algorithm to the true values by either overparametrization or introducing a black-box term that captures the unmodelled dynamics related to the off-diagonal components.</description>

      <title>Joint Radar Sensing, Location, and Communication Resources Optimization in 6G Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of jointly optimizing location sensing and communication resources, facilitated by the existence of communication and sensing spectrum sharing, is what promotes the system performance to a higher level. However, the rapid mobility of user equipment (UE) can result in inaccurate location estimation, which can severely degrade system performance. Therefore, the precise UE location sensing and resource allocation issues are investigated in a spectrum sharing sixth generation network. An approach is proposed for joint subcarrier and power optimization based on UE location sensing, aiming to minimize system energy consumption. The joint allocation process is separated into two key phases of operation. In the radar location sensing phase, the multipath interference and Doppler effects are considered simultaneously, and the issues of UE's location and channel state estimation are transformed into a convex optimization problem, which is then solved through gradient descent. In the communication phase, a subcarrier allocation method based on subcarrier weights is proposed. To further minimize system energy consumption, a joint subcarrier and power allocation method is introduced, resolved via the Lagrange multiplier method for the non-convex resource allocation problem. Simulation analysis results indicate that the location sensing algorithm exhibits a prominent improvement in accuracy compared to benchmark algorithms. Simultaneously, the proposed resource allocation scheme also demonstrates a substantial enhancement in performance relative to baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Space-Filling Input Design for Nonlinear State-Space Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of a model resulting from (black-box) system identification is highly dependent on the quality of the data that is used during the identification procedure. Designing experiments for linear time-invariant systems is well understood and mainly focuses on the power spectrum of the input signal. Performing experiment design for nonlinear system identification on the other hand remains an open challenge as informativity of the data depends both on the frequency-domain content and on the time-domain evolution of the input signal. Furthermore, as nonlinear system identification is much more sensitive to modeling and extrapolation errors, having experiments that explore the considered operation range of interest is of high importance. Hence, this paper focuses on designing space-filling experiments i.e., experiments that cover the full operation range of interest, for nonlinear dynamical systems that can be represented in a state-space form using a broad set of input signals. The presented experiment design approach can straightforwardly be extended to a wider range of system classes (e.g., NARMAX). The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated on the experiment design for a nonlinear mass-spring-damper system, using a multisine input signal.</description>

      <title>Volt-PF Control Mode for Distribution Feeder Voltage Management Under High Penetration of Distributed Energy Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volt-VAr control is a popular method for mitigating overvoltage violations caused by high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in distribution feeders. An inherent limitation of volt-VAr control is that the reactive power (Q) absorbed/injected by the DER is determined based only on the terminal voltage, without considering the active power (P) generated by the DER. This leads to an inequitable burden of Q support, in the sense that those DERs generating lower P, and hence contributing less to overvoltage issues, may be required to provide more than their share of $Q$ support. The resulting PF of these DERs is required to vary over a wide range, which many current DERs do not support. A new control scheme, namely volt-PF control, is proposed here where the Q support is inherently a function of both the voltage and $P$ from DERs, which alleviates the above concerns while limiting the PF variation within a narrow range of 0.9 to 1. The proposed scheme is validated through extensive static and dynamic simulations on a real, large (8000+ nodes) feeder with very high penetration (&gt;200%) of DERs.The implementation of the new scheme in new and existing commercial hardware inverters is described.</description>

      <title>On the analysis of a higher-order Lotka-Volterra model: an application of S-tensors and the polynomial complementarity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the effect of species' density on species' growth is non-additive in real ecological systems. This challenges the conventional Lotka-Volterra model, where the interactions are always pairwise and their effects are additive. To address this challenge, we introduce HOIs (Higher-Order Interactions) which are able to capture, for example, the indirect effect of one species on a second one correlating to a third species. Towards this end, we propose a general higher-order Lotka-Volterra model. We provide an existence result of a positive equilibrium for a non-homogeneous polynomial equation system with the help of S-tensors. Afterward, by utilizing the latter result, as well as the theory of monotone systems and results from the polynomial complementarity problem, we provide comprehensive results regarding the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the corresponding equilibrium. These results can be regarded as natural extensions of many analogous ones for the classical Lotka-Volterra model, especially in the case of full cooperation, competition among two factions, and pure competition. Finally, illustrative numerical examples are provided to highlight our contributions.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations in Latch-Mediated Spring Actuation (LaMSA) Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nature, different species of smaller animals produce ultra-fast movements to aid in their locomotion or protect themselves against predators. These ultra-fast impulsive motions are possible, as often times, there exist a small latch in the organism that could hold the potential energy of the system, and once released, generate an impulsive motion. These types of systems are classified as Latch Mediated Spring Actuated (LaMSA) systems, a multi-dimensional, multi-mode hybrid system that switches between a latched and an unlatched state. The LaMSA mechanism has been studied extensively in the field of biology and is observed in a wide range of animal species, such as the mantis shrimp, grasshoppers, and trap-jaw ants. In recent years, research has been done in mathematically modeling the LaMSA behavior with physical implementations of the mechanism. A significant focus is given to mimicking the physiological behavior of the species and following an end-to-end trajectory of impulsive motion. This paper introduces a foundational analysis of the theoretical dynamics of the contact latch-based LaMSA mechanism. The authors answer the question on what makes these small-scale systems impulsive, with a focus on the intrinsic properties of the system using bifurcations. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of the saddle fixed points. The authors propose a mathematical explanation for mediating the latch when a saddle node exists, and the impulsive behavior after the bifurcation happens.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Machine Learning-Enabled Optimization for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces-Aided 6G Networks: From Reinforcement Learning to Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17439</link>

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) becomes a promising technique for 6G networks by reshaping signal propagation in smart radio environments. However, it also leads to significant complexity for network management due to the large number of elements and dedicated phase-shift optimization. In this work, we provide an overview of machine learning (ML)-enabled optimization for RIS-aided 6G networks. In particular, we focus on various reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, e.g., deep Q-learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, transfer reinforcement learning, hierarchical reinforcement learning, and offline reinforcement learning. Different from existing studies, this work further discusses how large language models (LLMs) can be combined with RL to handle network optimization problems. It shows that LLM offers new opportunities to enhance the capabilities of RL algorithms in terms of generalization, reward function design, multi-modal information processing, etc. Finally, we identify the future challenges and directions of ML-enabled optimization for RIS-aided 6G networks.</description>

      <title>When Large Language Models Meet Optical Networks: Paving the Way for Automation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of GPT, large language models (LLMs) have brought about revolutionary advancements in all walks of life. As a superior natural language processing (NLP) technology, LLMs have consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous areas. However, LLMs are considered to be general-purpose models for NLP tasks, which may encounter challenges when applied to complex tasks in specialized fields such as optical networks. In this study, we propose a framework of LLM-empowered optical networks, facilitating intelligent control of the physical layer and efficient interaction with the application layer through an LLM-driven agent (AI-Agent) deployed in the control layer. The AI-Agent can leverage external tools and extract domain knowledge from a comprehensive resource library specifically established for optical networks. This is achieved through user input and well-crafted prompts, enabling the generation of control instructions and result representations for autonomous operation and maintenance in optical networks. To improve LLM's capability in professional fields and stimulate its potential on complex tasks, the details of performing prompt engineering, establishing domain knowledge library, and implementing complex tasks are illustrated in this study. Moreover, the proposed framework is verified on two typical tasks: network alarm analysis and network performance optimization. The good response accuracies and sematic similarities of 2,400 test situations exhibit the great potential of LLM in optical networks.</description>

      <title>Semi-Federated Learning for Internet of Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One key vision of intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) is to provide connected intelligence for a large number of application scenarios, such as self-driving cars, industrial manufacturing, and smart city. However, existing centralized or federated learning paradigms have difficulties in coordinating heterogeneous resources in distributed IoT environments. In this article, we introduce a semi-federated learning (SemiFL) framework to tackle the challenges of data and device heterogeneity in massive IoT networks. In SemiFL, only users with sufficient computing resources are selected for local model training, while the remaining users only transmit raw data to the base station for remote computing. By doing so, SemiFL incorporates conventional centralized and federated learning paradigms into a harmonized framework that allows all devices to participate in the global model training regardless of their computational capabilities and data distributions. Furthermore, we propose a next-generation multiple access scheme by seamlessly integrating communication and computation over the air. This achieves the concurrent transmission of raw data and model parameters in a spectrum-efficient manner. With their abilities to change channels and charge devices, two emerging techniques, reconfigurable intelligent surface and wireless energy transfer, are merged with our SemiFL framework to enhance its performance in bandwidth- and energy-limited IoT networks, respectively. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the superiority of our SemiFL for achieving edge intelligence among computing-heterogeneous IoT devices.</description>

      <title>Secure Hierarchical Federated Learning in Vehicular Networks Using Dynamic Client Selection and Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) faces the significant challenge of adversarial or unreliable vehicles in vehicular networks, which can compromise the model's integrity through misleading updates. Addressing this, our study introduces a novel framework that integrates dynamic vehicle selection and robust anomaly detection mechanisms, aiming to optimize participant selection and mitigate risks associated with malicious contributions. Our approach involves a comprehensive vehicle reliability assessment, considering historical accuracy, contribution frequency, and anomaly records. An anomaly detection algorithm is utilized to identify anomalous behavior by analyzing the cosine similarity of local or model parameters during the federated learning (FL) process. These anomaly records are then registered and combined with past performance for accuracy and contribution frequency to identify the most suitable vehicles for each learning round. Dynamic client selection and anomaly detection algorithms are deployed at different levels, including cluster heads (CHs), cluster members (CMs), and the Evolving Packet Core (EPC), to detect and filter out spurious updates. Through simulation-based performance evaluation, our proposed algorithm demonstrates remarkable resilience even under intense attack conditions. Even in the worst-case scenarios, it achieves convergence times at $63$\% as effective as those in scenarios without any attacks. Conversely, in scenarios without utilizing our proposed algorithm, there is a high likelihood of non-convergence in the FL process.</description>

Abstract: To address the challenges associated with shape sensing of continuum manipulators (CMs) using Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) optical fibers, we feature a unique shape sensing assembly utilizing solely a single Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR) fiber attached to a flat nitinol wire (NiTi). Integrating this easy-to-manufacture unique sensor with a long and soft CM with 170 mm length, we performed different experiments to evaluate its shape reconstruction ability. Results demonstrate phenomenal shape reconstruction accuracy for both C-shape (&lt; 2 mm tip error, &lt; 1.2 mm shape error) and J-shape (&lt; 3.4 mm tip error, &lt; 2.3 mm shape error) experiments.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Characterization of Low-Frequency Noise in 40-nm CMOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an extensive characterization of the low-frequency noise (LFN) at room temperature (RT) and cryogenic temperature (4.2 K) of 40-nm bulk-CMOS transistors. The noise is measured over a wide range of bias conditions and geometries to generate a comprehensive overview of LFN in this technology. While the RT results are in-line with the literature and the foundry models, the cryogenic behavior diverges in many aspects. These deviations include changes with respect to RT in magnitude and bias dependence that are conditional on transistor type and geometry, and even an additional systematic Lorentzian feature that is common among individual devices. Furthermore, we find the scaling of the average LFN with the area and its variability to be similar between RT and 4.2 K, with the cryogenic scaling reported systematically for the first time. The findings suggest that, as no consistent decrease of LFN at lower temperatures is observed while the white noise is reduced, the impact of LFN for precision analog design at cryogenic temperatures gains a more predominant role.</description>

      <title>Multi-Wheeled Passive Sliding with Fully-Actuated Aerial Robots: Tip-Over Recovery and Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the utilization of aerial manipulators for performing pushing tasks in non-destructive testing (NDT) applications has seen significant growth. Such operations entail physical interactions between the aerial robotic system and the environment. End-effectors with multiple contact points are often used for placing NDT sensors in contact with a surface to be inspected. Aligning the NDT sensor and the work surface while preserving contact, requires that all available contact points at the end-effector tip are in contact with the work surface. With a standard full-pose controller, attitude errors often occur due to perturbations caused by modeling uncertainties, sensor noise, and environmental uncertainties. Even small attitude errors can cause a loss of contact points between the end-effector tip and the work surface. To preserve full alignment amidst these uncertainties, we propose a control strategy which selectively deactivates angular motion control and enables direct force control in specific directions. In particular, we derive two essential conditions to be met, such that the robot can passively align with flat work surfaces achieving full alignment through the rotation along non-actively controlled axes. Additionally, these conditions serve as hardware design and control guidelines for effectively integrating the proposed control method for practical usage. Real world experiments are conducted to validate both the control design and the guidelines.</description>

      <title>A real/fast-time simulator for impact assessment of spoofing &amp; jamming attacks on GNSS receivers</title>

Abstract: In aviation, the impact of threats is becoming increasingly significant, particularly for global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Two relevant GNSS threats are represented by jamming and spoofing. In order to evaluate the technological solutions to counter GNSS attacks, such attacks should be assessed by means of a proper GNSS threat simulator. This work shows the implementation and the testing results of a GNSS security impact simulator which injects the desired threat scenarios as a deviations on the GNSS actual measurements. The proposed simulator can be integrated in both real- and fast-time simulation environments. The provided results confirm the effectiveness of the simulator, and include in-flight demonstrations by means of a flight experimental vehicle.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Model Predictive Control via Trust-Region Quasi-Newton Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control can optimally deal with nonlinear systems under consideration of constraints. The control performance depends on the model accuracy and the prediction horizon. Recent advances propose to use reinforcement learning applied to a parameterized model predictive controller to recover the optimal control performance even if an imperfect model or short prediction horizons are used. However, common reinforcement learning algorithms rely on first order updates, which only have a linear convergence rate and hence need an excessive amount of dynamic data. Higher order updates are typically intractable if the policy is approximated with neural networks due to the large number of parameters.
  In this work, we use a parameterized model predictive controller as policy, and leverage the small amount of necessary parameters to propose a trust-region constrained Quasi-Newton training algorithm for policy optimization with a superlinear convergence rate. We show that the required second order derivative information can be calculated by the solution of a linear system of equations. A simulation study illustrates that the proposed training algorithm outperforms other algorithms in terms of data efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Network Diffusion -- Framework to Simulate Spreading Processes in Complex Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of computational network science, its research scope has significantly expanded beyond static graphs to encompass more complex structures. The introduction of streaming, temporal, multilayer, and hypernetwork approaches has brought new possibilities and imposed additional requirements. For instance, by utilising these advancements, one can model structures such as social networks in a much more refined manner, which is particularly relevant in simulations of the spreading processes. Unfortunately, the pace of advancement is often too rapid for existing computational packages to keep up with the functionality updates. This results in a significant proliferation of tools used by researchers and, consequently, a lack of a universally accepted technological stack that would standardise experimental methods (as seen, e.g. in machine learning). This article addresses that issue by presenting an extended version of the Network Diffusion library. First, a survey of the existing approaches and toolkits for simulating spreading phenomena is shown and then, an overview of the framework functionalities. Finally, we report four case studies conducted with the package to demonstrate its usefulness: the impact of sanitary measures on the spread of COVID-19, the comparison of information diffusion on two temporal network models, and the effectiveness of seed selection methods in the task of influence maximisation in multilayer networks. We conclude the paper with a critical assessment of the library and the outline of still awaiting challenges to standardise research environments in computational network science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel design of a multi-agent system framework that applies a large language model (LLM) to automate the parametrization of process simulations in digital twins. We propose a multi-agent framework that includes four types of agents: observation, reasoning, decision and summarization. By enabling dynamic interaction between LLM agents and simulation model, the developed system can automatically explore the parametrization of the simulation and use heuristic reasoning to determine a set of parameters to control the simulation to achieve an objective. The proposed approach enhances the simulation model by infusing it with heuristics from LLM and enables autonomous search for feasible parametrization to solve a user task. Furthermore, the system has the potential to increase user-friendliness and reduce the cognitive load on human users by assisting in complex decision-making processes. The effectiveness and functionality of the system are demonstrated through a case study, and the visualized demos are available at a GitHub Repository: https://github.com/YuchenXia/LLMDrivenSimulation</description>

      <title>An approach to improve agent learning via guaranteeing goal reaching in all episodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning is commonly concerned with problems of maximizing accumulated rewards in Markov decision processes. Oftentimes, a certain goal state or a subset of the state space attain maximal reward. In such a case, the environment may be considered solved when the goal is reached. Whereas numerous techniques, learning or non-learning based, exist for solving environments, doing so optimally is the biggest challenge. Say, one may choose a reward rate which penalizes the action effort. Reinforcement learning is currently among the most actively developed frameworks for solving environments optimally by virtue of maximizing accumulated reward, in other words, returns. Yet, tuning agents is a notoriously hard task as reported in a series of works. Our aim here is to help the agent learn a near-optimal policy efficiently while ensuring a goal reaching property of some basis policy that merely solves the environment. We suggest an algorithm, which is fairly flexible, and can be used to augment practically any agent as long as it comprises of a critic. A formal proof of a goal reaching property is provided. Simulation experiments on six problems under five agents, including the benchmarked one, provided an empirical evidence that the learning can indeed be boosted while ensuring goal reaching property.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Distributionally Robust System Level Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for the control of uncertain, linear time-invariant systems, which are perturbed by potentially unbounded, additive disturbances. We propose a \emph{doubly robust} data-driven state-feedback controller to ensure reliable performance against both model mismatch and disturbance distribution uncertainty. Our controller, which leverages the System Level Synthesis parameterization, is designed as the solution to a distributionally robust finite-horizon optimal control problem. The goal is to minimize a cost function while satisfying constraints against the worst-case realization of the uncertainty, which is quantified using distributional ambiguity sets. The latter are defined as balls in the Wasserstein metric centered on the predictive empirical distribution computed from a set of collected trajectory data. By harnessing techniques from robust control and distributionally robust optimization, we characterize the distributional shift between the predictive and the actual closed-loop distributions, and highlight its dependency on the model mismatch and the uncertainty about the disturbance distribution. We also provide bounds on the number of samples required to achieve a desired confidence level and propose a tractable approximate formulation for the doubly robust data-driven controller. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present a numerical example showcasing the performance of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Sensor-Based Distributionally Robust Control for Safe Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for safe mobile robot navigation in dynamic, unknown environments, utilizing onboard sensing to impose safety constraints without the need for accurate map reconstruction. Traditional methods typically rely on detailed map information to synthesize safe stabilizing controls for mobile robots, which can be computationally demanding and less effective, particularly in dynamic operational conditions. By leveraging recent advances in distributionally robust optimization, we develop a distributionally robust control barrier function (DR-CBF) constraint that directly processes range sensor data to impose safety constraints. Coupling this with a control Lyapunov function (CLF) for path tracking, we demonstrate that our CLF-DR-CBF control synthesis method achieves safe, efficient, and robust navigation in uncertain dynamic environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in simulated and real autonomous robot navigation experiments, marking a substantial advancement in real-time safety guarantees for mobile robots.</description>

      <title>Identifiability, Observability, Uncertainty and Bayesian System Identification of Epidemiological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this project, identifiability, observability and uncertainty properties of the deterministic and Chain Binomial stochastic SIR, SEIR and SEIAR epidemiological models are studied. Techniques for modeling overdispersion are investigated and used to compare simulated trajectories for moderately sized, homogenous populations. With the chosen model parameters overdispersion was found to have small impact, but larger impact on smaller populations and simulations closer to the initial outbreak of an epidemic. Using a software tool for model identifiability and observability (DAISY[Bellu et al. 2007]), the deterministic SIR and SEIR models was found to be structurally identifiable and observable under mild conditions, while SEIAR in general remains structurally unidentifiable and unobservable. Sequential Monte Carlo and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods were implemented in a custom C++ library and applied to stochastic SIR, SEIR and SEIAR models in order to generate parameter distributions. With the chosen model parameters overdispersion was found to have a small impact on parameter distributions for SIR and SEIR models. For SEIAR, the algorithm did not converge around the true parameters of the deterministic model. The custom C++ library was found to be computationally efficient, and is very likely to be used in future projects.</description>

      <title>Reset Controller Synthesis by Reach-avoid Analysis for Delay Hybrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A reset controller plays a crucial role in designing hybrid systems. It restricts the initial set and redefines the reset map associated with discrete transitions, in order to guarantee the system to achieve its objective. Reset controller synthesis, together with feedback controller synthesis and switching logic controller synthesis, provides a correct-by-construction approach to designing hybrid systems. However, time-delay is an inevitable factor in hybrid systems, which can degrade control performance and render verification certificates obtained by abstracting away time-delay invalid in practice. In this paper, we investigate this issue in a practical manner by taking time-delay into account. We propose an approach that reduces the synthesis of reset controllers to the generation of reach-avoid sets for the hybrid system under consideration, which can be efficiently solved using off-the-shell convex optimization solvers.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Power Theory Revisited with Classical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper revisits the concepts of instantaneous active and reactive powers and provides a novel definition for basic circuit elements based on quantities utilized in classical mechanics, such as absolute and relative velocity, momentum density, angular momentum and apparent forces. The discussion leverages from recent publications by the authors that interpret the voltage and current as velocities in generalized Lagrangian coordinates. The main result of the paper is a general and compact expression for the instantaneous active and reactive power of inductances, capacitances and resistances as a multivector proportional to the generalized kinetic energy and the geometric frequency multivector. Several numerical examples considering stationary and transient sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal conditions are discussed in the case study.</description>

      <title>On Accessibility Fairness in Intermodal Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on the operation of mobility systems so far has mostly focused on minimizing cost-centered metrics such as average travel time, distance driven, and operational costs. Whilst capturing economic indicators, such metrics do not account for transportation justice aspects. In this paper, we present an optimization model to plan the operation of Intermodal Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (I-AMoD) systems, where self-driving vehicles provide on-demand mobility jointly with public transit and active modes, with the goal to minimize the accessibility unfairness experienced by the population. Specifically, we first leverage a previously developed network flow model to compute the I-AMoD system operation in a minimum-time manner. Second, we formally define accessibility unfairness, and use it to frame the minimum-accessibility-unfairness problem and cast it as a linear program. We showcase our framework for a real-world case-study in the city of Eindhoven, NL. Our results show that it is possible to reach an operation that is on average fully fair at the cost of a slight travel time increase compared to a minimum-travel-time solution. Thereby we observe that the accessibility fairness of individual paths is, on average, worse than the average values obtained from flows, setting the stage for a discussion on the definition of accessibility fairness itself.</description>

      <title>Learning Locally Interacting Discrete Dynamical Systems: Towards Data-Efficient and Scalable Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locally interacting dynamical systems, such as epidemic spread, rumor propagation through crowd, and forest fire, exhibit complex global dynamics originated from local, relatively simple, and often stochastic interactions between dynamic elements. Their temporal evolution is often driven by transitions between a finite number of discrete states. Despite significant advancements in predictive modeling through deep learning, such interactions among many elements have rarely explored as a specific domain for predictive modeling. We present Attentive Recurrent Neural Cellular Automata (AR-NCA), to effectively discover unknown local state transition rules by associating the temporal information between neighboring cells in a permutation-invariant manner. AR-NCA exhibits the superior generalizability across various system configurations (i.e., spatial distribution of states), data efficiency and robustness in extremely data-limited scenarios even in the presence of stochastic interactions, and scalability through spatial dimension-independent prediction.</description>

      <title>A general framework for supporting economic feasibility of generator and storage energy systems through capacity and dispatch optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integration of various electricity-generating technologies (such as natural gas, wind, nuclear, etc.) with storage systems (such as thermal, battery electric, hydrogen, etc.) has the potential to improve the economic competitiveness of modern energy systems. Driven by the need to efficiently assess the economic feasibility of various energy system configurations in early system concept development, this work outlines a versatile computational framework for assessing the net present value of various integrated storage technologies. The subsystems' fundamental dynamics are defined, with a particular emphasis on balancing critical physical and economic domains to enable optimal decision-making in the context of capacity and dispatch optimization. In its presented form, the framework formulates a linear, convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved using a direct transcription approach in the open-source software DTQP. Three case studies demonstrate and validate the framework's capabilities, highlighting its value and computational efficiency in facilitating the economic assessment of various energy system configurations. In particular, natural gas with thermal storage and carbon capture, wind energy with battery storage, and nuclear with hydrogen are demonstrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To advance control, operation and planning tools of electrical networks with ML is not straightforward. 110 experts were surveyed showing where and how ML algorithmis could advance. This paper assesses this survey and research environment. Then it develops an innovation roadmap that helps align our research community towards a goal-oriented realisation of the opportunities that AI upholds. This paper finds that the R\&amp;D environment of system operators (and the surrounding research ecosystem) needs adaptation to enable faster developments with AI while maintaining high testing quality and safety. This roadmap may interest research centre managers in system operators, academics, and labs dedicated to advancing the next generation of tooling for electrical networks.</description>

      <title>Towards a Low-SWaP 1024-beam Digital Array: A 32-beam Sub-system at 5.8 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millimeter wave communications require multibeam beamforming in order to utilize wireless channels that suffer from obstructions, path loss, and multi-path effects. Digital multibeam beamforming has maximum degrees of freedom compared to analog phased arrays. However, circuit complexity and power consumption are important constraints for digital multibeam systems. A low-complexity digital computing architecture is proposed for a multiplication-free 32-point linear transform that approximates multiple simultaneous RF beams similar to a discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Arithmetic complexity due to multiplication is reduced from the FFT complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N\: \log N)$ for DFT realizations, down to zero, thus yielding a 46% and 55% reduction in chip area and dynamic power consumption, respectively, for the $N=32$ case considered. The paper describes the proposed 32-point DFT approximation targeting a 1024-beams using a 2D array, and shows the multiplierless approximation and its mapping to a 32-beam sub-system consisting of 5.8 GHz antennas that can be used for generating 1024 digital beams without multiplications. Real-time beam computation is achieved using a Xilinx FPGA at 120 MHz bandwidth per beam. Theoretical beam performance is compared with measured RF patterns from both a fixed-point FFT as well as the proposed multiplier-free algorithm and are in good agreement.</description>

      <title>Outlier-robust Kalman Filtering through Generalised Bayes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a novel, provably robust, and closed-form Bayesian update rule for online filtering in state-space models in the presence of outliers and misspecified measurement models. Our method combines generalised Bayesian inference with filtering methods such as the extended and ensemble Kalman filter. We use the former to show robustness and the latter to ensure computational efficiency in the case of nonlinear models. Our method matches or outperforms other robust filtering methods (such as those based on variational Bayes) at a much lower computational cost. We show this empirically on a range of filtering problems with outlier measurements, such as object tracking, state estimation in high-dimensional chaotic systems, and online learning of neural networks.</description>
