      <title>A Generalized Second-Order Positivity-Preserving Numerical Method for Non-Autonomous Dynamical Systems with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a generalized, second-order, nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) method for non-autonomous dynamical systems. The proposed method combines the NSFD framework with a new non-local approximation of the right-hand side function. This method achieves second-order convergence and unconditionally preserves the positivity of solutions for all step sizes. Especially, it avoids the restrictive conditions required by many existing positivity-preserving, second-order NSFD methods. The method is easy to implement and computationally efficient. Numerical experiments, including an improved NSFD scheme for an SIR epidemic model, confirm the theoretical results. Additionally, we demonstrate the method's applicability to nonlinear partial differential equations and boundary value problems with positive solutions, showcasing its versatility in real-world modeling.</description>

      <title>Generalized rational Prony and Bernoulli methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized operator-based Prony method is an important tool for describing signals which can be written as finite linear combinations of eigenfunctions of certain linear operators. On the other hand, Bernoulli's algorithm and its generalizations can be used to recover the parameters of rational functions belonging to finite-dimensional subspaces of $H_2$ Hardy-Hilbert spaces. In this work, we discuss several results related to these methods. We discuss a rational variant of the generalized operator-based Prony method and show that in fact, any Prony problem can be treated this way. This realization establishes the connection between Prony and Bernoulli methods and allows us to address some well-known numerical pitfalls. Several numerical experiments are provided to showcase the usefulness of the introduced methods. These include problems related to the identification of time-delayed linear systems and parameter recovery problems in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>General Order Virtual Element Approximation for the Smagorinsky turbulence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a Smagorinsky model in a virtual element framework to simulate convection-dominated Navier-Stokes equations. We conduct a two-dimensional numerical investigation to assess the performance of the general order virtual element approximation in this context. First, we examine numerically the convergence of the method with respect to the meshsize to certify the novel virtual element numerical discretization, which includes, for the first time, a discretization of the Smagorinsky term. Moreover, we present a numerical study of a lid-driven cavity for different Reynolds numbers (up to 10000) and meshes (uniform, anisotropic, and isotropic with hanging nodes). The results highlight the main advantage of using the virtual elements method in this context: the isotropic refinement with hanging nodes enhances the accuracy of the solution compared to the anisotropic mesh, uses fewer degrees of freedom with respect to the uniform mesh, and yields the most stable behavior in terms of convergence of the Newton solver.</description>

      <title>Fully discrete finite element methods for the stochastic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a fully discrete finite element approximation for the stochastic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, combining the standard finite element methods in spatial discretization with the implicit Euler-Maruyama scheme in time. Rigorous error estimates are established for two distinct noise regimes. In the case of bounded multiplicative noise, we prove optimal strong convergence rates in full expectation. The analysis relies crucially on a stochastic Gronwall inequality and an exponential stability estimate for the PDE solution, which together control the interplay between the nonlinear drift and the multiplicative stochastic forcing. For general multiplicative noise, where boundedness no longer holds, we derive sub-optimal convergence rates in probability by introducing a localization technique based on carefully constructed subsets of the sample space. This dual framework demonstrates that the proposed fully discrete scheme achieves strong convergence under bounded noise and probabilistic convergence under general multiplicative noise, thus providing the first comprehensive error analysis for numerical approximations of the stochastic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.</description>

      <title>A Variational Method for Conformable Fractional Equations Using Rank-One Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make a complete variational treatment of rank-one Proper Generalised Decomposition for separable fractional partial differential equations with conformable derivatives. The setting is Hilbertian, the energy is induced by a symmetric coercive bilinear form, and the residual is placed in the dual space. A greedy rank-one update is obtained by maximizing an energy Rayleigh quotient over the rank-one manifold, followed by an exact line search. An exact one step energy decrease identity is proved, together with geometric decay of the energy error under a weak greedy condition that measures how well the search captures the Riesz representer of the residual. The alternating least squares realization is analyzed at the level of operators, including well posedness of the alternating subproblems, a characterization of stationary points, and monotonicity of the Rayleigh quotient along the inner iteration. Discretizations based on weighted finite elements and on Gr\"unwald type schemes are described in detail, including assembly, boundary conditions, complexity, and memory. Two model problems, a stationary fractional Poisson problem and a space time fractional diffusion problem, are treated from the continuous level down to matrices.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Galerkin method for scattering poles of sound soft obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of scattering poles for a sound-soft obstacle is investigated. These poles correspond to the eigenvalues of two boundary integral operators. We construct novel decompositions of these operators and show that they are Fredholm. Then a Fourier-Galerkin method is proposed for discretization. By establishing the regular convergence of the discrete operators, an error estimate is established using the abstract approximation theory for eigenvalue problems of holomorphic Fredholm operator functions. We give details of the numerical implementation. Several examples are presented to validate the theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>High-order, Compact, and Symmetric Finite Difference Methods for a $d$-Dimensional Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents compact, symmetric, and high-order finite difference methods (FDMs) for the variable Poisson equation on a $d$-dimensional hypercube. Our scheme produces a symmetric linear system: an important property that does not immediately hold for a high-order FDM. Since the model problem is coercive, the linear system is in fact symmetric positive definite, and consequently many fast solvers are applicable. Furthermore, the symmetry combined with the minimum support of the stencil keeps the storage requirement minimal. Theoretically speaking, we prove that a compact, symmetric 1D FDM on a uniform grid can achieve arbitrary consistency order. On the other hand, in the $d$-dimensional setting, where $d \ge 2$, the maximum consistency order that a compact, symmetric FDM on a uniform grid can achieve is 4. If $d=2$ and the diffusion coefficient satisfies a certain derivative condition, the maximum consistency order is 6. Moreover, the finite compact, symmetric, 4th-order FDMs for $d\ge 3$, can be conveniently expressed as a linear combination of two types of FDMs: one that depends on partial derivatives along one axis, and the other along two axes. All finite difference stencils are explicitly provided for ease of reproducibility.</description>

      <title>A discrete data assimilation algorithm for the reconstruction of Gray--Scott dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gray--Scott model governs the interaction of two chemical species via a system of reaction-diffusion equations. Despite its simple form, it produces extremely rich patterns such as spots, stripes, waves, and labyrinths. That makes it ideal for studying emergent behavior, self-organization, and instability-driven pattern formation. It is also known for its sensitivity to poorly observed initial conditions. Using such initial conditions alone quickly leads simulations to deviate from the true dynamics. The present paper addresses this challenge with a nudging-based data assimilation algorithm: coarse, cell-averaged measurements are injected into the model through a feedback (nudging) term, implemented as a finite-volume interpolant. We prove two main results. (i) For the continuous problem, the nudged solution synchronizes with the true dynamics, and the $L^2$-error decays exponentially under conditions that tie observation resolution, nudging gains, and diffusion. (ii) For the fully discrete semi-implicit finite-volume scheme, the same synchronization holds, up to a mild time-step restriction. Numerical tests on labyrinthine patterns support the theory. They show recovery of fine structure from sparse data and clarify how the observation resolution, the nudging gain, and the frequency of updates affect the decay rate.</description>

      <title>Sharp Lower Bounds for Linearized ReLU^k Approximation on the Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a saturation theorem for linearized shallow ReLU$^k$ neural networks on the unit sphere $\mathbb S^d$. For any antipodally quasi-uniform set of centers, if the target function has smoothness $r&gt;\tfrac{d+2k+1}{2}$, then the best $\mathcal{L}^2(\mathbb S^d)$ approximation cannot converge faster than order $n^{-\frac{d+2k+1}{2d}}$. This lower bound matches existing upper bounds, thereby establishing the exact saturation order $\tfrac{d+2k+1}{2d}$ for such networks. Our results place linearized neural-network approximation firmly within the classical saturation framework and show that, although ReLU$^k$ networks outperform finite elements under equal degrees $k$, this advantage is intrinsically limited.</description>

      <title>High order well-balanced and total-energy-conserving local discontinuous Galerkin methods for compressible self-gravitating Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a high order structure-preserving local discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for the compressible self-gravitating Euler equations, which pose great challenges due to the presence of time-dependent gravitational potential. The designed scheme is well-balanced for general polytropic equilibrium state and total energy conserving for multiple spatial dimensions without an assumption of spherical symmetry. The well-balanced property is achieved by decomposing the gravitational potential into equilibrium and perturbation parts, employing a modified Harten-Lax-van Leer-contact flux and a modification of the discretization for the source term. Conservation of total energy is particularly challenging in the presence of self-gravity, especially when aiming for high order accuracy. To address this, we rewrite the energy equation into a conservative form, and carefully design an energy flux with the aid of weak formulation from the DG method to maintain conservation as well as high order accuracy. The resulting scheme can be extended to high order in time discretizations. Numerical examples for two and three dimensional problems are provided to verify the desired properties of our proposed scheme, including shock-capturing, high order accuracy, well balance, and total energy conservation.</description>

      <title>Bound-Preserving WENO Schemes for Temple-class systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores numerical schemes for Temple-class systems, which are integral to various applications including one-dimensional two-phase flow, elasticity, traffic flow, and sedimentation. Temple-class systems are characterized by conservative equations, with different pressure function expressions leading to specific models such as the Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) traffic model and the sedimentation model. Our work extends existing studies by introducing a moving mesh approach to address the challenges of preserving non-convex invariant domains, a common issue in the numerical simulation of such systems. Our study outlines a novel bound-preserving (BP) and conservative numerical scheme, designed specifically for non-convex sets in Temple-class systems, which is critical for avoiding non-physical solutions and ensuring robustness in simulations. We develop both local and global BP methods based on finite difference schemes, with numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness and reliability of our methods. Furthermore, a parameterized flux limiter is introduced to restrict high-order fluxes and maintain bound preservation. This innovation marks the first time such a parameterized approach has been applied to non-convex sets, offering significant improvements over traditional methods. The findings presented extend beyond theoretical implications, as they are applicable to general Temple-class systems and can be tailored to ARZ traffic flow networks, highlighting the versatility and broad applicability of our approach. The paper contributes significantly to the field by providing a comprehensive method that maintains the physical and mathematical constrains of Temple-class systems.</description>

      <title>Robust and efficient solvers for nonlinear partial differential equations based on random feature method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random feature method (RFM), a mesh-free machine learning-based framework, has emerged as a promising alternative for solving PDEs on complex domains. However, for large three-dimensional nonlinear problems, attaining high accuracy typically requires domain partitioning with many collocation points and random features per subdomain, which leads to extremely large and ill-conditioned nonlinear least-squares systems. To overcome these challenges, we propose two randomized Newton-type solvers. The first is an inexact Newton method with right preconditioning (IPN), in which randomized Jacobian compression and QR factorization are used to construct an efficient preconditioner that substantially reduces the condition number. Each Newton step is then approximately solved by LSQR, and a derivative-free line search is incorporated to ensure residual reduction and stable convergence. Building upon this framework, we further develop an adaptive multi-step inexact preconditioned Newton method (AMIPN). In this approach, the preconditioned Jacobian is reused across multiple inner iterations, while a prescribed maximum number of inner iterations together with an adaptive early-stopping criterion determines whether the current preconditioner can be retained in subsequent outer iterations. These mechanisms effectively avoid redundant computations and enhance robustness. Extensive numerical experiments on both three-dimensional steady-state and two-dimensional time-dependent PDEs with complex geometries confirm the remarkable effectiveness of the proposed solvers. Compared with classical discretization techniques and recent machine-learning-based approaches, the methods consistently deliver substantial accuracy improvements and robust convergence, thereby establishing the RFM combined with IPN/AMIPN as an efficient framework for large-scale nonlinear PDEs. .</description>

      <title>A note on spectral Monte-Carlo method for fractional Poisson equation on high-dimensional ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a class of efficient spectral Monte-Carlo methods was developed in \cite{Feng2025ExponentiallyAS} for solving fractional Poisson equations. These methods fully consider the low regularity of the solution near boundaries and leverage the efficiency of walk-on-spheres algorithms, achieving spectral accuracy. However, the underlying formulation is essentially one-dimensional. In this work, we extend this approach to radial solutions in general high-dimensional balls. This is accomplished by employing a different set of eigenfunctions for the fractional Laplacian and deriving new interpolation formulas. We provide a comprehensive description of our methodology and a detailed comparison with existing techniques. Numerical experiments confirm the efficacy of the proposed extension.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of the Random Ordinate Method for Mitigating the Ray Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Discrete Ordinates Method (DOM) is widely used for velocity discretization in radiative transport simulations. However, DOM tends to exhibit the ray effect when the velocity discretization is not sufficiently refined, a limitation that is well documented. To counter this, we have developed the Random Ordinates Method (ROM) by integrating randomness into the velocity discretization, which mitigates the ray effect without incurring additional computational costs. ROM partitions the velocity space into n cells, selects a random ordinate from each cell, and solves a DOM system with these ordinates. It leverages the average of multiple samples to achieve a higher convergence order, especially for solutions with low regularity in the velocity variable. In this work, we provide a detailed convergence analysis for ROM, focusing on bias and single-run errors. This analysis is crucial for determining the necessary mesh size and the optimal number of samples required to attain a specified level of accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse potential problem consists in determining the density of the volume potential from measurements outside the sources. Its ill-posedness is due both to the non-uniqueness of the solution and to the instability of the solution with respect to measurement errors. The inverse problem is solved under additional assumptions about the sources using regularizing algorithms. In this work, an inverse problem is posed for identifying the domain that contains the sources. The computational algorithm is based on approximating the volume potential by the single-layer potential on the boundary of the domain containing the sources. The inverse problem is considered in the class of a priori constraints of nonnegativity of the potential density. Residual minimization in the class of nonnegative solutions is performed using the classical Nonnegative Least Squares algorithm. The capabilities of the proposed approach are illustrated by numerical experiments for a two-dimensional test problem with an analytically prescribed potential on the observation surface.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Boundary Conditions for Atomistic Dislocation Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a higher-order boundary condition for atomistic simulations of dislocations that address the slow convergence of standard supercell methods. The method is based on a multipole expansion of the equilibrium displacement, combining continuum predictor solutions with discrete moment corrections. The continuum predictors are computed by solving a hierarchy of singular elliptic PDEs via a Galerkin spectral method, while moment coefficients are evaluated from force-moment identities with controlled approximation error. A key feature is the coupling between accurate continuum predictors and moment evaluations, enabling the construction of systematically improvable high-order boundary conditions. We thus design novel algorithms, and numerical results for screw and edge dislocations confirm the predicted convergence rates in geometry and energy norms, with reduced finite-size effects and moderate computational cost.</description>

      <title>SubApSnap: Solving parameter-dependent linear systems with a snapshot and subsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing number of problems in computational mathematics can be reduced to the solution of many linear systems that are related, often depending smoothly or slowly on a parameter $p$, that is, $A(p)x(p)=b(p)$. We introduce an efficient algorithm for solving such parameter-dependent linear systems for many values of $p$. The algorithm, which we call SubApSnap (for \emph{Sub}sampled $A(p)$ times \emph{Snap}shot), is based on combining ideas from model order reduction and randomised linear algebra: namely, taking a snapshot matrix, and solving the resulting tall-skinny least-squares problems using a subsampling-based dimension-reduction approach. We show that SubApSnap is a strict generalisation of the popular DEIM algorithm in nonlinear model order reduction. SubApSnap is a sublinear-time algorithm, and once the snapshot and subsampling are determined, it solves $A(p_*)x(p_*)=b(p_*)$ for a new value of $p_*$ at a dramatically improved speed: it does not even need to read the whole matrix $A(p_*)$ to solve the linear system for a new value of $p_*$. We prove under natural assumptions that, given a good subsampling and snapshot, SubApSnap yields solutions with small residual for all parameter values of interest. We illustrate the efficiency and performance of the algorithm with problems arising in PDEs, model reduction, and kernel ridge regression, where SubApSnap achieves speedups of many orders of magnitude over a standard solution; for example over $20,000\times$ for a $10^7\times 10^7$ problem, while providing good accuracy.</description>

      <title>Efficient structure-preserving scheme for chemotaxis PDEs with singular sensitivity in crime and epidemic modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The system of chemotaxis PDEs with singular sensitivity was originally proposed by Short et al. [Math. Mod. Meth. Appl. Sci., 18:1249-1267, 2008] as the continuum limit of a biased random walk model to account for the formation of crime hotspots and environmental feedback successfully. Recently, this idea has also been applied to epidemiology to model the impact of human social behaviors on disease transmission. In order to characterize the phase transition, pattern formation and statistical properties in the long-term dynamics, a stable and accurate numerical scheme is urgently demanded, which still remains challenging due to the positivity constraint on the singular sensitivity and the absence of an energy functional. To address these numerical challenges, this paper constructs an efficient positivity-preserving, implicit-explicit scheme with second-order accuracy. A rigorous error estimation is provided with the Lagrange multiplier correction to deal with the singular sensitivity. The whole framework is extended to a multi-agent epidemic model with degenerate diffusion, in which both positivity and mass conservation are achieved. Typical numerical examples are conducted to validate our theoretical results and to demonstrate the necessity of correction strategy. The proposed scheme allows us to study the nucleation, spread, and dissipation of crime hotspots, as well as validate that clustering of population density may accelerate virus transmission in epidemic dynamics and potentially aggravate the second infectious wave.</description>

      <title>Data-driven linear solver selection and performance tuning for multiphysics simulations in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling multiphysics processes in porous media requires preconditioned iterative linear solvers to enable efficient simulations at industry-relevant scales. These solvers are typically composed of sub-algorithms that target individual physical processes. Various options are available for each algorithm, with the corresponding ranges of numerical parameters. The choices of sub-algorithms and their parameters significantly affects simulation performance and robustness. Optimizing these choices for each simulation is challenging due to the vast number of possible combinations. Moreover, optimization relies on performance data from past simulations, which becomes less representative as the simulation setup changes. This paper addresses the problem of automated selection and tuning of preconditioned linear solvers for multiphysics simulations. The proposed solver selection algorithm collects performance data during the run of the target simulation and continuously updates a machine learning model responsible for solver selection, resulting in an adaptively refined selection policy. The algorithm is evaluated on two time-dependent nonlinear model problems: (i) coupled fluid flow and heat transfer in porous media and (ii) thermo-poromechanics in porous media with fractures, governed by frictional contact mechanics. These experiments demonstrate that the algorithm selects efficient and robust solvers with negligible overhead and performs comparably to a reference selection policy that has full access to the performance data of prior simulations. Our results indicate that the proposed approach effectively addresses the challenge of solver selection and tuning, providing particular value to simulation engineers and researchers, especially when expert knowledge on linear solver tuning is not readily available.</description>

      <title>Cluster Analysis for Globally Coupled Map using Optimal Transport Distance and Complexity of Attractor-ruin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show the results of the strength of attractorruins for a globally coupled map. The globally coupled map (GCM) is a discrete dynamical system, and here we consider a model in which the logistic map is globally coupled. An attractor-ruin is a set in which the attractor is destabilized by a change in parameters, which is characterized by a Milnor attractor. Intermittent phenomena called chaotic itinerancy, in which orbits transition between attractor-ruin, have been observed in various complex systems, and their onset mechanisms and statistical properties have attracted attention. In this study, the instability of orbits of GCM is analyzed from the perspective of clustering using the optimal transport distance, and the strength of attractor-ruins is numerically evaluated by applying this method. As a result, it was found that the strength of various attractor-ruins is high in the parameter region called the partially ordered phase, where chaotic itinerancy occurs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control theory of dynamical systems offers a powerful framework for tackling challenges in deep neural networks and other machine learning architectures. We show that concepts such as simultaneous and ensemble controllability offer new insights into the classification and representation properties of deep neural networks while the control and optimization of static systems can be employed to better understand the performance of shallow networks. Inspired by the classical concept of turnpike, we also explore the relationship between dynamic and static neural networks, where depth is traded for width, and the role of transformers as mechanisms for accelerating classical neural network tasks. We also exploit the expressive power of neural networks (exemplified, for instance, by the Universal Approximation Theorem) to develop a novel hybrid modeling methodology, the Hybrid-Cooperative Learning (HYCO), combining mechanics and data-driven methods in a game-theoretic setting. Finally, we describe how classical properties of diffusion processes, long established in the context of partial differential equations, contribute to explaining the success of modern generative artificial intelligence (AI). We present an overview of our recent results in these areas, illustrating how control, machine learning, numerical analysis, and partial differential equations come together to motivate a fertile ground for future research.</description>

      <title>Generalized Orders of Magnitude for Scalable, Parallel, High-Dynamic-Range Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many domains, from deep learning to finance, require compounding real numbers over long sequences, often leading to catastrophic numerical underflow or overflow. We introduce generalized orders of magnitude (GOOMs), a principled extension of traditional orders of magnitude that incorporates floating-point numbers as a special case, and which in practice enables stable computation over significantly larger dynamic ranges of real numbers than previously possible. We implement GOOMs, along with an efficient custom parallel prefix scan, to support native execution on parallel hardware such as GPUs. We demonstrate that our implementation of GOOMs outperforms traditional approaches with three representative experiments, all of which were previously considered impractical or impossible, and now become possible and practical: (1) compounding real matrix products far beyond standard floating-point limits; (2) estimating spectra of Lyapunov exponents in parallel, orders of magnitude faster than with previous methods, applying a novel selective-resetting method to prevent state colinearity; and (3) capturing long-range dependencies in deep recurrent neural networks with non-diagonal recurrent states, computed in parallel via a prefix scan, without requiring any form of stabilization. Our results show that our implementation of GOOMs, combined with efficient parallel scanning, offers a scalable and numerically robust alternative to conventional floating-point numbers for high-dynamic-range applications.</description>

      <title>A Direct Approach for Detection of Bottom Topography in Shallow Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a fast, stable, and direct analytic method to detect underwater channel topography from surface wave measurements, based on one-dimensional shallow water equations. The technique requires knowledge of the free surface and its first two time derivatives at a single instant $t^{\star}$ above the fixed, bounded open segment of the domain. We first restructure the forward shallow water equations to obtain an inverse model in which the bottom profile is the only unknown, and then discretize this model using a second-order finite-difference scheme to infer the floor topography. We demonstrate that the approach satisfies a Lipschitz stability and is independent of the initial conditions of the forward problem. The well-posedness of this inverse model requires that, at the chosen measurement time $t^{\star}$, the discharge be strictly positive across the fixed portion of the open channel, which is automatically satisfied for steady and supercritical flows. For unsteady subcritical and transcritical flows, we derive two empirically validated sufficient conditions ensuring strict positivity after a sufficiently large time. The proposed methodology is tested on a range of scenarios, including classical benchmarks and different types of inlet discharges and bathymetries. We find that this analytic approach yields high approximation accuracy and that the bed profile reconstruction is stable under noise. In addition, the sufficient conditions are met across all tests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate numerical solutions of partial differential equations are essential in many scientific fields but often require computationally expensive solvers, motivating reduced-order models (ROMs). Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) is a data-driven ROM framework that combines autoencoders with equation discovery to learn interpretable latent dynamics. However, enforcing latent dynamics during training can compromise reconstruction accuracy of the model for simulation data. We introduce multi-stage LaSDI (mLaSDI), a framework that improves reconstruction and prediction accuracy by sequentially learning additional decoders to correct residual errors from previous stages. Applied to the 1D-1V Vlasov equation, mLaSDI consistently outperforms standard LaSDI, achieving lower prediction errors and reduced training time across a wide range of architectures.</description>

      <title>LLM-Guided Evolutionary Program Synthesis for Quasi-Monte Carlo Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-discrepancy point sets and digital sequences underpin quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for high-dimensional integration. We cast two long-standing QMC design problems as program synthesis and solve them with an LLM-guided evolutionary loop that mutates and selects code under task-specific fitness: (i) constructing finite 2D/3D point sets with low star discrepancy, and (ii) choosing Sobol' direction numbers that minimize randomized QMC error on downstream integrands. Our two-phase procedure combines constructive code proposals with iterative numerical refinement. On finite sets, we rediscover known optima in small 2D cases and set new best-known 2D benchmarks for N &gt;= 40, while matching most known 3D optima up to the proven frontier (N &lt;= 8) and reporting improved 3D benchmarks beyond. On digital sequences, evolving Sobol' parameters yields consistent reductions in randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (rQMC) mean-squared error for several 32-dimensional option-pricing tasks relative to widely used Joe--Kuo parameters, while preserving extensibility to any sample size and compatibility with standard randomizations. Taken together, the results demonstrate that LLM-driven evolutionary program synthesis can automate the discovery of high-quality QMC constructions, recovering classical designs where they are optimal and improving them where finite-N structure matters.

      <description>arXiv:2510.03745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-discrepancy points are designed to efficiently fill the space in a uniform manner. This uniformity is highly advantageous in many problems in science and engineering, including in numerical integration, computer vision, machine perception, computer graphics, machine learning, and simulation. Whereas most previous low-discrepancy constructions rely on abstract algebra and number theory, Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC) was recently introduced to exploit machine learning methods for generating point sets with lower discrepancy than previously possible. However, MPMC is limited to generating point sets and cannot be extended to low-discrepancy sequences (LDS), i.e., sequences of points in which every prefix has low discrepancy, a property essential for many applications. To address this limitation, we introduce Neural Low-Discrepancy Sequences ($NeuroLDS$), the first machine learning-based framework for generating LDS. Drawing inspiration from classical LDS, we train a neural network to map indices to points such that the resulting sequences exhibit minimal discrepancy across all prefixes. To this end, we deploy a two-stage learning process: supervised approximation of classical constructions followed by unsupervised fine-tuning to minimize prefix discrepancies. We demonstrate that $NeuroLDS$ outperforms all previous LDS constructions by a significant margin with respect to discrepancy measures. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of $NeuroLDS$ across diverse applications, including numerical integration, robot motion planning, and scientific machine learning. These results highlight the promise and broad significance of Neural Low-Discrepancy Sequences. Our code can be found at https://github.com/camail-official/neuro-lds.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Efficient Algorithms for Inverse Optimal Transport with Bregman Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work analyzes the inverse optimal transport (IOT) problem under Bregman regularization. We establish well-posedness results, including existence, uniqueness (up to equivalence classes of solutions), and stability, under several structural assumptions on the cost matrix. On the computational side, we investigate the existence of solutions to the optimization problem with general constraints on the cost matrix and provide a sufficient condition guaranteeing existence. In addition, we propose an inexact block coordinate descent (BCD) method for the problem with a strongly convex penalty term. In particular, when the penalty is quadratic, the subproblems admit a diagonal Hessian structure, which enables highly efficient element-wise Newton updates. We establish a linear convergence rate for the algorithm and demonstrate its practical performance through numerical experiments, including the validation of stability bounds, the investigation of regularization effects, and the application to a marriage matching dataset.</description>

      <title>Analysis of kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo under the stochastic exponential Euler discretization from underdamped all the way to overdamped</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the kinetic Langevin dynamics is a popular approach for sampling from distributions, where only their unnormalized densities are available. Various discretizations of the kinetic Langevin dynamics have been considered, where the resulting algorithm is collectively referred to as the kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo (KLMC) or underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo. Specifically, the stochastic exponential Euler discretization, or exponential integrator for short, has previously been studied under strongly log-concave and log-Lipschitz smooth potentials via the synchronous Wasserstein coupling strategy. Existing analyses, however, impose restrictions on the parameters that do not explain the behavior of KLMC under various choices of parameters. In particular, all known results fail to hold in the overdamped regime, suggesting that the exponential integrator degenerates in the overdamped limit. In this work, we revisit the synchronous Wasserstein coupling analysis of KLMC with the exponential integrator. Our refined analysis results in Wasserstein contractions and bounds on the asymptotic bias that hold under weaker restrictions on the parameters, which assert that the exponential integrator is capable of stably simulating the kinetic Langevin dynamics in the overdamped regime, as long as proper time acceleration is applied.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Explanation of Transformers for Large Language Models and GPTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized the field of sequence modeling and underpins the recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs). However, a comprehensive mathematical theory that explains its structure and operations remains elusive. In this work, we propose a novel continuous framework that rigorously interprets the Transformer as a discretization of a structured integro-differential equation. Within this formulation, the self-attention mechanism emerges naturally as a non-local integral operator, and layer normalization is characterized as a projection to a time-dependent constraint. This operator-theoretic and variational perspective offers a unified and interpretable foundation for understanding the architecture's core components, including attention, feedforward layers, and normalization. Our approach extends beyond previous theoretical analyses by embedding the entire Transformer operation in continuous domains for both token indices and feature dimensions. This leads to a principled and flexible framework that not only deepens theoretical insight but also offers new directions for architecture design, analysis, and control-based interpretations. This new interpretation provides a step toward bridging the gap between deep learning architectures and continuous mathematical modeling, and contributes a foundational perspective to the ongoing development of interpretable and theoretically grounded neural network models.</description>

      <title>Optimal frames for Phase Retrieval from Edge Vectors of Optimal Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to characterize the optimal frame for phase retrieval, defined as the frame whose condition number for phase retrieval attains its minimal value. In the context of the two-dimensional real case, we reveal the connection between optimal frames for phase retrieval and the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem, originally proposed by Reinhardt in 1922. Our work establishes that every optimal solution to the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem inherently leads to an optimal frame in ${\mathbb R}^2$. By recasting the optimal polygons problem as one concerning the discrepancy of roots of unity, we characterize all optimal polygons. Building upon this connection, we then characterize all optimal frames with $m$ vectors in ${\mathbb R}^2$ for phase retrieval when $m \geq 3$ has an odd factor. As a key corollary, we show that the harmonic frame $E_m$ is {\em not} optimal for any even integer $m \geq 4$. This finding disproves a conjecture proposed by Xia, Xu, and Xu (Math. Comp., 90(356): 2931-2960). Previous work has established that the harmonic frame $E_m \subset {\mathbb R}^2$ is indeed optimal when $m$ is an odd integer.
  Exploring the connection between phase retrieval and discrete geometry, this paper aims to illuminate advancements in phase retrieval and offer new perspectives on the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem.</description>

      <title>Why Cannot Neural Networks Master Extrapolation? Insights from Physical Laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the remarkable success of Foundation Models (FMs) in language modeling, there has been growing interest in developing FMs for time series prediction, given the transformative power such models hold for science and engineering. This culminated in significant success of FMs in short-range forecasting settings. However, extrapolation or long-range forecasting remains elusive for FMs, which struggle to outperform even simple baselines. This contrasts with physical laws which have strong extrapolation properties, and raises the question of the fundamental difference between the structure of neural networks and physical laws. In this work, we identify and formalize a fundamental property characterizing the ability of statistical learning models to predict more accurately outside of their training domain, hence explaining performance deterioration for deep learning models in extrapolation settings. In addition to a theoretical analysis, we present empirical results showcasing the implications of this property on current deep learning architectures. Our results not only clarify the root causes of the extrapolation gap but also suggest directions for designing next-generation forecasting models capable of mastering extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Can Linear Probes Measure LLM Uncertainty?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) represents a key aspect for reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automated decision-making and beyond. Yet, for LLM generation with multiple choice structure, the state-of-the-art in UQ is still dominated by the naive baseline given by the maximum softmax score. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate that taking a principled approach via Bayesian statistics leads to improved performance despite leveraging the simplest possible model, namely linear regression. More precisely, we propose to train multiple Bayesian linear models, each predicting the output of a layer given the output of the previous one. Based on the obtained layer-level posterior distributions, we infer the global uncertainty level of the LLM by identifying a sparse combination of distributional features, leading to an efficient UQ scheme. Numerical experiments on various LLMs show consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>PolyKAN: A Polyhedral Analysis Framework for Provable and Minimal KAN Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), offering enhanced interpretability and a strong mathematical foundation. However, their parameter efficiency remains a significant challenge for practical deployment. This paper introduces PolyKAN, a novel theoretical framework for KAN compression that provides formal guarantees on both model size reduction and approximation error. By leveraging the inherent piecewise polynomial structure of KANs, we formulate the compression problem as one of optimal polyhedral region merging. We establish a rigorous polyhedral characterization of KANs, develop a complete theory of $\epsilon$-equivalent compression, and design an optimal dynamic programming algorithm that guarantees minimal compression under specified error bounds. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that PolyKAN achieves provably minimal compression while maintaining strict error control, with polynomial-time complexity in all network parameters. The framework provides the first formal foundation for KAN compression with mathematical guarantees, opening new directions for efficient deployment of interpretable neural architectures.</description>

      <title>Towards Fast Option Pricing PDE Solvers Powered by PIELM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE) solvers underpin modern quantitative finance, governing option pricing and risk evaluation. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving the forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations (PDEs) using deep learning. However they remain computationally expensive due to their iterative gradient descent based optimization and scale poorly with increasing model size. This paper introduces Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machines (PIELMs) as fast alternative to PINNs for solving both forward and inverse problems in financial PDEs. PIELMs replace iterative optimization with a single least-squares solve, enabling deterministic and efficient training. We benchmark PIELM on the Black-Scholes and Heston-Hull-White models for forward pricing and demonstrate its capability in inverse model calibration to recover volatility and interest rate parameters from noisy data. From experiments we observe that PIELM achieve accuracy comparable to PINNs while being up to $30\times$ faster, highlighting their potential for real-time financial modeling.</description>

Abstract: Let N be a square-free positive integer and let f be a newform of weight 2 on \Gamma_0(N). Let A denote the abelian subvariety of J_0(N) associated to f and let m be a maximal ideal of the Hecke algebra T that contains Ann_T(f) and has residue characteristic r such that r does not divide 6N. We show that if either A[m] or the canonical representation \rho_m over T/m associated to m is reducible, then r divides the order of the cuspidal subgroup of J_0(N) and A[m] has a nontrivial rational point. We mention some applications of this result, including an application to the second part of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for A.</description>

      <title>Environment-Aware Indoor LoRaWAN Path Loss: Parametric Regression Comparisons, Shadow Fading, and Calibrated Fade Margins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor LoRaWAN propagation is shaped by structural and time-varying context factors, which challenge log-distance models and the assumption of log-normal shadowing. We present an environment-aware, statistically disciplined path loss framework evaluated using leakage-safe cross-validation on a 12-month campaign in an eighth-floor office measuring 240 m^2. A log-distance multi-wall mean is augmented with environmental covariates (relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure), as well as the signal-to-noise ratio. We compare multiple linear regression with regularized variants, Bayesian linear regression, and a selective second-order polynomial applied to continuous drivers. Predictor relevance is established using heteroscedasticity-robust Type II and III analysis of variance and nested partial F tests. Shadow fading is profiled with kernel density estimation and non-parametric families, including Normal, Skew-Normal, Student's t, and Gaussian mixtures. The polynomial mean reduces cross-validated RMSE from 8.07 to 7.09 dB and raises R^2 from 0.81 to 0.86. Out-of-fold residuals are non-Gaussian; a 3-component mixture captures a sharp core with a light, broad tail. We convert accuracy into reliability by prescribing the fade margin as the upper-tail quantile of cross-validated residuals, quantifying uncertainty via a moving-block bootstrap, and validating on a held-out set. At 99% packet delivery ratio, the environment-aware polynomial requires 25.7 dB versus 27.7 to 27.9 dB for linear baselines. This result presents a deployment-ready, interpretable workflow with calibrated reliability control for indoor Internet of Things planning, aligned with 6G targets.</description>

      <title>The method of the approximate inverse for limited-angle CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limited-angle computerized tomography stands for one of the most difficult challenges in imaging. Although it opens the way to faster data acquisition in industry and less dangerous scans in medicine, standard approaches, such as the filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm or the widely used total-variation functional, often produce various artefacts that hinder the diagnosis. With the rise of deep learning, many modern techniques have proven themselves successful in removing such artefacts but at the cost of large datasets. In this paper, we propose a new model-driven approach based on the method of the approximate inverse, which could serve as new starting point for learning strategies in the future. In contrast to FBP-type approaches, our reconstruction step consists in evaluating linear functionals on the measured data using reconstruction kernels that are precomputed as solution of an auxiliary problem. With this problem being uniquely solvable, the derived limited-angle reconstruction kernel (LARK) is able to fully reconstruct the object without the well-known streak artefacts, even for large limited angles. However, it inherits severe ill-conditioning which leads to a different kind of artefacts arising from the singular functions of the limited-angle Radon transform. The problem becomes particularly challenging when working on semi-discrete (real or analytical) measurements. We develop a general regularization strategy, named constrained limited-angle reconstruction kernel (CLARK), by combining spectral filter, the method of the approximate inverse and custom edge-preserving denoising in order to stabilize the whole process. We further derive and interpret error estimates for the application on real, i.e. semi-discrete, data and we validate our approach on synthetic and real data.</description>

It is designed to reduce staircasing with respect to the classical Rudin--Osher--Fatemi model, while preserving the edges of the image in a similar fashion. We implement the model and test its performance on synthetic and natural images in 1D and 2D over a range of noise levels.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving MHD-Driftkinetic Discretization for Wave-Particle Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a structure-preserving discretization of the hybrid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)-driftkinetic system for simulations of low-frequency wave-particle interactions. The model equations are derived from a variational principle, assuring energetically consistent couplings between MHD fluids and driftkinetic particles. The spatial discretization is based on a finite-element-exterior-calculus (FEEC) framework for the MHD and a particle-in-cell (PIC) method for the driftkinetic. A key feature of the scheme is the inclusion of the non-quadratic particle magnetic moment energy term in the Hamiltonian, which is introduced by the guiding-center approximation. The resulting discrete Hamiltonian structure naturally organizes the dynamics into skew-symmetric subsystems, enabling balanced energy exchange. To handle the non-quadratic energy term, we develop energy-preserving time integrators based on discrete gradient methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source Python package \texttt{STRUPHY}. Numerical experiments confirm the energy-conserving property of the scheme and demonstrate the capability to simulate energetic particles (EP) induced excitation of toroidal Alfv\'en eigenmodes (TAE) without artificial dissipation or mode filtering. This capability highlights the potential of structure-preserving schemes for high-fidelity simulations of hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Overlapping Schwarz Scheme for Linear-Quadratic Programs in Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an optimize-then-discretize framework for solving linear-quadratic optimal control problems (OCP) governed by time-inhomogeneous ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Our method employs a modified overlapping Schwarz decomposition based on the Pontryagin Minimum Principle, partitioning the temporal domain into overlapping intervals and independently solving Hamiltonian systems in continuous time. We demonstrate that the convergence is ensured by appropriately updating the boundary conditions of the individual Hamiltonian dynamics. The cornerstone of our analysis is to prove that the exponential decay of sensitivity (EDS) exhibited in discrete-time OCPs carries over to the continuous-time setting. Unlike the discretize-then-optimize approach, our method can flexibly incorporate different numerical integration methods for solving the resulting Hamiltonian two-point boundary-value subproblems, including adaptive-time integrators. A numerical experiment on a linear-quadratic OCP illustrates the practicality of our approach in broad scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Validity condition of normal form transformation for the $\beta$-FPUT system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a validity condition for the normal form transformation to remove the non-resonant cubic terms in the $\beta$-FPUT system. We show that for a wave field with random phases, the normal form transformation is valid by dominant probability if $\beta \ll 1/N^{1+\epsilon}$, with $N$ the number of masses and $\epsilon$ an arbitrarily small constant. To obtain this condition, a bound is needed for a summation in the transformation equation, which we prove rigorously in the paper. The condition also suggests that the importance of the non-resonant terms in the evolution equation is governed by the parameter $\beta N$. We design numerical experiments to demonstrate that this is indeed the case for spectra at both thermal-equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium conditions. The methodology developed in this paper is applicable to other Hamiltonian systems where a normal form transformation needs to be applied.</description>

      <title>Power Transform Revisited: Numerically Stable, and Federated</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power transforms are popular parametric techniques for making data more Gaussian-like, and are widely used as preprocessing steps in statistical analysis and machine learning. However, we find that direct implementations of power transforms suffer from severe numerical instabilities, which can lead to incorrect results or even crashes. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the sources of these instabilities and propose effective remedies. We further extend power transforms to the federated learning setting, addressing both numerical and distributional challenges that arise in this context. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods are both effective and robust, substantially improving stability compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Divergence conforming finite element methods for flow-transport coupling with osmotic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model for the coupling of flow and transport equations with porous membrane-type conditions on part of the boundary. The governing equations consist of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations coupled with an advection-diffusion equation, and we employ a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the coupling between penetration velocity and transport on the membrane, while mixed boundary conditions are considered in the remainder of the boundary. We show existence and uniqueness of the continuous problem using a fixed-point argument. Next, an H(div)-conforming finite element formulation is proposed, and we address its a priori error analysis. The method uses an upwind approach that provides stability in the convection-dominated regime. We showcase a set of numerical examples validating the theory and illustrating the use of the new methods in the simulation of reverse osmosis processes.</description>

      <title>Reproducing kernel methods for machine learning, PDEs, and statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This monograph develops a unified, application-driven framework for kernel methods grounded in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and optimal transport (OT). Part I lays the theoretical and numerical foundations on positive-definite kernels; discrete and continuous RKHS; kernel engineering and scaling maps; error assessment via kernel discrepancy/maximum mean discrepancy (MMD); and a systematic operator view of kernels. In this viewpoint, projection, gradient, divergence, and Laplace-Beltrami operators are built directly from kernels, enabling discrete analogues of differential operators and variational tools that connect learning with PDE-style modeling. Part II turns to practice across four domains. In machine learning, we treat supervised and unsupervised tasks, then develop RKHS-based generative modeling, contrasting density and projection approaches and enhancing them with OT and scalable, combinatorial assignments. We introduce clustering strategies that reduce computational burden and support large-scale regression and transport. In physics-informed modeling, we present mesh-free kernel discretizations for elliptic and time-dependent PDEs, discuss automatic differentiation, and propose high-order discrete approximations. In reinforcement learning, we formulate kernel Q-learning and non-parametric HJB methods, and show how kernel operators yield sample-efficient baselines on continuous-state, discrete-action tasks. In mathematical finance, we build nonparametric time-series models and market generators, study benchmarking and extrapolation for pricing, and apply the framework to stress testing and portfolio methods.</description>

      <title>A Random Integration Algorithm for High-dimensional Function Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16627v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel random integration algorithm that boasts both high convergence order and polynomial tractability for functions characterized by sparse frequencies or rapidly decaying Fourier coefficients. Specifically, for integration in periodic isotropic Sobolev space and the isotropic Sobolev space with compact support, our approach attains a nearly optimal root mean square error (RMSE) bound. In contrast to previous nearly optimal algorithms, our method exhibits polynomial tractability, ensuring that the number of samples does not scale exponentially with increasing dimensions. Our integration algorithm also enjoys nearly optimal bound for weighted Korobov space. Furthermore, the algorithm can be applied without the need for prior knowledge of weights, distinguishing it from the component-by-component algorithm. For integration in the Wiener algebra, the sample complexity of our algorithm is independent of the decay rate of Fourier coefficients. The effectiveness of the integration is confirmed through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Improved two-block coordinate descent method for Pose Graph Optimization Problem under $F^*$-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual quaternions and dual quaternion matrices are widely used in robotics research, particularly in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. Using dual quaternion theory and graph-based methods, SLAM can be reformulated as a rank-one dual quaternion Hermitian matrix completion problem, known as the pose graph optimization (PGO) problem. Recently, Qi and Cui introduced a two-block coordinate descent method to solve this reformulated problem. In this paper, we enhance this method by reformulating the PGO problem under the more appropriate and robust F*-norm rather than the conventional Frobenius norm, leading to improved experimental accuracy. We show that under the F*-norm, one block has a closed-form solution and another is the optimal rank-one approximation of dual quaternion Hermitian matrices under the F*-norm. We derive an explicit solution for this approximation and present an efficient algorithm to compute it. To further enhance the two-block coordinate descent method, we introduce proper parameter selection, stagnation-based termination criteria and an effective spectral initialization strategy. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our refinements deliver superior accuracy, faster computation, and higher success rates, particularly in low-observation settings. In particular, using the F*-norm outperforms the traditional F-norm, underscoring its ability to more faithfully capture the magnitude of the dual parts of dual quaternion matrices.</description>

      <title>Virtual finite element and hyperbolic problems: the PAMPA algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01341v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of the Virtual Element Method concepts to solve scalar and system hyperbolic problems on general polygonal grids. The new schemes stem from the active flux approach \cite{AF1}, which combines the usage of point values at the element boundaries with an additional degree of freedom representing the average of the solution within each control volume. Along the lines of the family of residual distribution schemes introduced in \cite{Abgrall_AF,abgrall2023activefluxtriangularmeshes} \red{that integrate the active flux technique}, we devise novel third order accurate methods that rely on the VEM technology to discretize gradients of the numerical solution by means of a polynomial-free approximation, \red{by} adopting a virtual basis that is locally defined for each element. The obtained discretization is globally continuous, and for nonlinear problems it needs a stabilization which is provided by \new{a monolithic convex limiting strategy extended from \cite{Abgrall_BP_PAMPA}}. This is applied to both point and average values of the discrete solution. We show applications to scalar problems, as well as to the acoustics and Euler equations in two dimension. The accuracy and the robustness of the proposed schemes are assessed against a suite of benchmarks involving smooth solutions, shock waves and other discontinuities.</description>

      <title>A finite volume scheme for the local sensing chemotaxis model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we design, analyze and simulate a finite volume scheme for a cross-diffusion system which models chemotaxis with local sensing. This system has the same Lyapunov function (or entropy) as the celebrated minimal Keller-Segel system, but unlike the latter, its solutions are known to exist globally in 2D. The long-time behavior of solutions is only partially understood which motivates numerical exploration with a reliable numerical method. We propose a linearly implicit, two-point flux finite volume approximation of the system. We show that the scheme preserves, at the discrete level, the main features of the continuous system, namely mass conservation, non-negativity of solution, entropy dissipation, and duality estimates. These properties allow us to prove the well-posedness, unconditional stability and convergence of the scheme. We also show rigorously that the scheme possesses an asymptotic preserving (AP) property in the quasi-stationary limit. We complement our analysis with thorough numerical experiments investigating convergence and AP properties of the scheme as well as its reliability with respect to stability properties of steady solutions.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis and simulation of lateral memristive devices: Schottky, ohmic, and multi-dimensional electrode models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the numerical analysis and simulations of a multi-dimensional memristive device model. Memristive devices and memtransistors based on two-dimensional (2D) materials have demonstrated promising potential for neuromorphic computing and next-generation memory technologies. Our charge transport model describes the drift-diffusion of electrons, holes, and ionic defects self-consistently in an electric field. We incorporate two types of boundary models: ohmic and Schottky contacts. The coupled drift-diffusion partial differential equations are discretized using a physics-preserving Voronoi finite volume method. It relies on an implicit time-stepping scheme and the excess chemical potential flux approximation. We demonstrate that the fully discrete nonlinear scheme is unconditionally stable, preserving the free-energy structure of the continuous system and ensuring the non-negativity of carrier densities. Novel discrete entropy-dissipation inequalities for both boundary condition types in multiple dimensions allow us to prove the existence of discrete solutions. We perform multi-dimensional simulations to understand the impact of electrode configurations and device geometries, focusing on the hysteresis behavior in lateral 2D memristive devices. Three electrode configurations -- side, top, and mixed contacts -- are compared numerically for different geometries and boundary conditions. These simulations reveal the conditions under which a simplified one-dimensional electrode geometry can well represent the three electrode configurations. This work lays the foundations for developing accurate, efficient simulation tools for 2D memristive devices and memtransistors, offering tools and guidelines for their design and optimization in future applications.</description>

      <title>Numerical Hopf-Lax formulae for Hamilton-Jacobi equations on unstructured geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a scheme of Semi-Lagrangian (SL) type for the numerical solution of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation on unstructured triangular grids. As it is well known, SL schemes are not well suited for unstructured grids, due to the cost of the point location phase; this drawback is augmented by the need for repeated minimization. In this work, we propose a scheme that works only on the basis of node values and connectivity of the grid. In a first version, we obtain a monotone scheme; then, applying a quadratic refinement to the numerical solution, we improve accuracy at the price of some extra computational cost. The scheme can be applied to both time-dependent and stationary HJ equations; in the latter case, we also study the construction of a fast policy iteration solver. We perform a theoretical analysis of the two versions, and validate them with an extensive set of examples, both in the time-dependent and in the stationary case.</description>

Abstract: We introduce MAGPIE (Multilevel-Adaptive-Guided Ptychographic Iterative Engine), a stochastic multigrid solver for the ptychographic phase-retrieval problem. The ptychographic phase-retrieval problem is inherently nonconvex and ill-posed. To address these challenges, we reformulate the original nonlinear and nonconvex inverse problem as the iterative minimization of a quadratic surrogate model that majorizes the original objective. This surrogate not only ensures favorable convergence properties but also generalizes the Ptychographic Iterative Engine (PIE) family of algorithms. By solving the surrogate model using a multigrid method, MAGPIE achieves substantial gains in convergence speed and reconstruction quality over traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>Dual Formulation Finite-Volume Methods on Overlapping Meshes for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce new second-order schemes for one- and two-dimensional hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. Following an approach recently proposed in [{\sc R. Abgrall}, Commun. Appl. Math. Comput., 5 (2023), pp. 370--402], we consider two different formulations of the studied system (the original conservative formulation and a primitive one containing nonconservative products), and discretize them on overlapping staggered meshes using two different numerical schemes. The novelty of our approach is twofold. First, we introduce an original paradigm making use of overlapping finite-volume (FV) meshes over which cell averages of conservative and primitive variables are evolved using semi-discrete FV methods: The nonconservative system is discretized by a path-conservative central-upwind scheme, and its solution is used to evaluate very simple numerical fluxes for the discretization of the original conservative system. Second, to ensure the nonlinear stability of the resulting method, we design a post-processing, which also guarantees a conservative coupling between the two sets of variables. We test the proposed semi-discrete dual formulation finite-volume methods on several benchmarks for the Euler equations of gas dynamics.</description>

      <title>Sharp error bounds for approximate eigenvalues and singular values from subspace methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subspace methods are commonly used for finding approximate eigenvalues and singular values of large-scale matrices. Once a subspace is found, the Rayleigh-Ritz method (for symmetric eigenvalue problems) and Petrov-Galerkin projection (for singular values) are the de facto method for extraction of eigenvalues and singular values. In this work we derive quadratic error bounds for approximate eigenvalues of symmetric matrices obtained via the Rayleigh-Ritz process. Our bounds take advantage of the fact that extremal eigenpairs tend to converge faster than the rest, hence having smaller residuals $\|A\widehat x_i-\theta_i\widehat x_i\|_2$, where $(\theta_i,\widehat x_i)$ is a Ritz pair (approximate eigenpair). The proof uses the structure of the perturbation matrix underlying the Rayleigh-Ritz method to bound the components of its eigenvectors. In this way, we obtain a bound of the form $c\frac{\|A\widehat x_i-\theta_i\widehat x_i\|_2^2}{\mbox{Gap}_i}$, where $\mbox{Gap}_i$ is roughly the gap between the $i$th Ritz value and the eigenvalues that are not approximated by the Ritz process, and $c&gt; 1$ is a modest scalar. Our bound is adapted to each Ritz value and is robust to clustered Ritz values, which is a key improvement over existing results. We further show that the bound is asymptotically sharp, and generalize it to singular values of arbitrary real matrices. Finally, we apply these bounds to several methods for computing eigenvalues and singular values, and illustrate the sharpness of our bounds in a number of computational settings, including Krylov methods and randomized algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We consider the numerical reconstruction of the spatially dependent conductivity coefficient and the source term in elliptic partial differential equations in a two-dimensional convex polygonal domain, with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition and given interior observations of the solution. Using data assimilation, we derive approximated gradients of the error functional to update the reconstructed coefficients. New $L^2$ error estimates are provided for the spatially discretized reconstructions. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the method and demonstrate the error estimates. The numerical results also show that the reconstruction is very robust to the errors in specific inputted coefficients.</description>

      <title>HANN: Homotopy auxiliary neural network for solving nonlinear algebraic equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving nonlinear algebraic equations is a fundamental but challenging problem in scientific computations and also has many applications in system engineering. Though traditional iterative methods and modern optimization algorithms have exerted effective roles in addressing certain specific problems, there still exist certain weaknesses such as the initial value sensitivity, limited accuracy and slow convergence rate, particulary without flexible input for the neural network methods. In this paper, we propose a homotopy auxiliary neural network (HANN) for solving nonlinear algebraic equations which integrates the classical homotopy continuation method and popular physics-informed neural network. Consequently, the HANN-1 has strong learning ability and can rapidly give an acceptable solution for the problem which outperforms some known methods, while the HANN-2 can further improve its accuracy. Numerical results on the benchmark problems confirm that the HANN method can effectively solve the problems of determining the total number of solutions of a single equation, finding solutions of transcendental systems involving the absolute value function or trigonometric function, ill-conditioned and normal high-dimensional nonlinear systems and time-varying nonlinear problems, for which the Python's built-in Fsolve function exhibits significant limitations, even fails to work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05512v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the characteristic generator, a novel one-step generative model that combines the efficiency of sampling in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the stable performance of flow-based models. Our model is driven by characteristics, along which the probability density transport can be described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Specifically, we first estimate the underlying velocity field and use the Euler method to solve the probability flow ODE, generating discrete approximations of the characteristics. A deep neural network is then trained to fit these characteristics, creating a one-step map that pushes a simple Gaussian distribution to the target distribution. In the theoretical aspect, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the errors arising from velocity matching, Euler discretization, and characteristic fitting to establish a non-asymptotic convergence rate in the 2-Wasserstein distance under mild data assumptions. Crucially, we demonstrate that under a standard manifold assumption, this convergence rate depends only on the intrinsic dimension of data rather than the much larger ambient dimension, proving our model's ability to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous convergence analysis for a flow-based one-step generative model. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the characteristic generator achieves high-quality and high-resolution sample generation with the efficiency of just a single neural network evaluation.</description>

      <title>Numerical stabilization method by switching time-delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new numerical strategy for the stabilization of evolution systems. The method is based on the methodology given by Ammari, Nicaise andPignotti in ''Stabilization by switching time-delay, Asymptot. Anal., 83 (2013), 263--283''. This method is then implemented in 1D by suitable numerical approximation techniques. Numerical experiments complete this study to confirm the theoretical announced results.</description>

      <title>Random ordinate method for mitigating the ray effect in radiative transport equation simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Discrete Ordinates Method (DOM) is the most widely used velocity discretization method for simulating the radiative transport equation. However, the ray effect is a long-standing drawback of DOM. In benchmark tests that exhibit the ray effect, we observe low regularity in the velocity variable of the solution. To address this issue, we propose a Random Ordinate Method (ROM) to mitigate the ray effect. Compared to other strategies proposed in the literature for mitigating the ray effect, ROM offers several advantages: 1) For benchmark tests that exhibit ray effect, the computational cost is lower than that of the DOM; 2) it is simple and requires minimal changes to existing DOM-based code; 3) it is easily parallelizable and independent of the problem setup. A formal analysis is presented for the convergence orders of the error and bias. Numerical tests demonstrate the reduction in computational cost compared to DOM, as well as its effectiveness in mitigating the ray effect.</description>

      <title>Concrete convergence rates for common fixed point problems under Karamata regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of Karamata regular operators, which is a notion of regularity that is suitable for obtaining concrete convergence rates for common fixed point problems. This provides a broad framework that includes, but goes beyond, H\"olderian error bounds and H\"older regular operators. By concrete, we mean that the rates we obtain are explicitly expressed in terms of a function of the iteration number $k$ instead, of say, a function of the iterate $x^k$. While it is well-known that under H\"olderian-like assumptions many algorithms converge linearly/sublinearly (depending on the exponent), little it is known when the underlying problem data does not satisfy H\"olderian assumptions, which may happen if a problem involves exponentials and logarithms. Our main innovation is the usage of the theory of regularly varying functions which we showcase by obtaining concrete convergence rates for quasi-cylic algorithms in non-H\"olderian settings. This includes certain rates that are neither sublinear nor linear but sit somewhere in-between, including a case where the rate is expressed via the Lambert W function. Finally, we connect our discussion to o-minimal geometry and show that, under mild assumptions, definable operators in any o-minimal structure are always Karamata regular.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparsification of Simplicial Complexes via Local Densities of States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simplicial complexes (SCs) have become a popular abstraction for analyzing complex data using tools from topological data analysis or topological signal processing. However, the analysis of many real-world datasets often leads to dense SCs, with many higher-order simplicies, which results in prohibitive computational requirements in terms of time and memory consumption. The sparsification of such complexes is thus of broad interest, i.e., the approximation of an original SC with a sparser surrogate SC (with typically only a log-linear number of simplices) that maintains the spectrum of the original SC as closely as possible. In this work, we develop a novel method for a probabilistic sparsification of SCs that uses so-called local densities of states. Using this local densities of states, we can efficiently approximate so-called generalized effective resistance of each simplex, which is proportional to the required sampling probability for the sparsification of the SC. To avoid degenerate structures in the spectrum of the corresponding Hodge Laplacian operators, we suggest a ``kernel-ignoring'' decomposition to approximate the sampling probability. Additionally, we utilize certain error estimates to characterize the asymptotic algorithmic complexity of the developed method. We demonstrate the performance of our framework on a family of Vietoris--Rips filtered simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Fast nonparametric spectral density estimation from irregularly sampled data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00492v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nonparametric spectral density estimator for continuous-time and continuous-space processes measured at fully irregular locations. Our estimator is constructed using a weighted nonuniform Fourier sum whose weights yield a high-accuracy quadrature rule with respect to a user-specified window function. The resulting estimator significantly reduces the aliasing seen in periodogram approaches and least squares spectral analysis, sidesteps the dangers of ill-conditioning of the nonuniform Fourier inverse problem, and can be adapted to a wide variety of irregular sampling settings. We describe methods for rapidly computing the necessary weights in various settings, making the estimator scalable to large datasets. We then provide a theoretical analysis of sources of bias, and close with demonstrations of the method's efficacy, including for processes that exhibit very slow spectral decay and are observed at up to a million locations in multiple dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quadrature rules with few nodes supported on algebraic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quadrature rules for measures supported on real algebraic and rational curves, focusing on the {odd-degree} case \(2s-1\). Adopting an optimization viewpoint, we minimize suitable penalty functions over the space of quadrature rules of strength \(2s-1\), so that optimal solutions yield rules with the minimal number of nodes. For plane algebraic curves of degree \(d\), we derive explicit node bounds depending on \(d\) and the number of places at infinity, improving results of Riener--Schweighofer, and Zalar. For rational curves in arbitrary dimension of degree \(d\), we further refine these bounds using the geometry of the parametrization and recover the classical Gaussian quadrature bound when \(d=1\). Our results reveal a direct link between the algebraic complexity of the supporting curve and the minimal size of quadrature formulas, providing a unified framework that connects real algebraic geometry, polynomial optimization, and moment theory.</description>

      <title>A first-order method for constrained nonconvex--nonconcave minimax problems under a local Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of constrained nonconvex--nonconcave minimax problems in which the inner maximization involves potentially complex constraints. Under the assumption that the inner problem of a novel lifted minimax problem satisfies a local Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) condition, we show that the maximal function of the original problem enjoys a local H\"older smoothness property. We also propose a sequential convex programming (SCP) method for solving constrained optimization problems and establish its convergence rate under a local KL condition. Leveraging these results, we develop an inexact proximal gradient method for the original minimax problem, where the inexact gradient of the maximal function is computed via the SCP method applied to a locally KL-structured subproblem. Finally, we establish complexity guarantees for the proposed method in computing an approximate stationary point of the original minimax problem.</description>
