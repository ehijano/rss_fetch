      <title>Excitation of whistler-mode waves by an electron temperature anisotropy in a laboratory plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Naturally-occurring whistler-mode waves in near-Earth space play a crucial role in accelerating electrons to relativistic energies and scattering them in pitch angle, driving their precipitation into Earth's atmosphere. Here, we report on the results of a controlled laboratory experiment focusing on the excitation of whistler waves via temperature anisotropy instabilities--the same mechanism responsible for their generation in space. In our experiments, anisotropic energetic electrons, produced by perpendicularly propagating microwaves at the equator of a magnetic mirror, provide the free energy for whistler excitation. The observed whistler waves exhibit a distinct periodic excitation pattern, analogous to naturally occurring whistler emissions in space. Particle-in-cell simulations reveal that this periodicity arises from a self-regulating process: whistler-induced pitch-angle scattering rapidly relaxes the electron anisotropy, which subsequently rebuilds due to continuous energy injection and further excites wave. Our results have direct implications for understanding the process and characteristics of whistler emissions in near-Earth space.</description>

      <title>Understanding The Effects of Geotechnical Properties on Viscous Erosion Rate from Plume Surface Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With humans returning to the Moon under the Artemis program, understanding and mitigating effects from Plume Surface Interactions (PSI) will be essential for the protection of personnel and equipment on the Moon. To help characterize the underlying mechanics associated with viscous erosion and crater formation, experimental measurements using regolith simulants and subsonic, non-reacting flows were completed using compressed air in a splitter plate, plume cratering setup. More specifically, these investigations examined the underlying effects of bulk density, cohesion, and exhaust flow characteristics on viscous erosion rates and crater formation using Lunar highlands simulant (LHS-1), Lunar mare simulant (LMS-1), LHS-1D (Dust) simulants, and 40-80 um glass beads in atmosphere. Results show that particle size distribution can ultimately influence crater shapes and erosion rates, likely owing to internal angle of friction. Measurements show that increasing bulk density, especially from an uncompacted to a slightly compacted state, decreases erosion rate by as much as 50%. While cohesion of granular material can mitigate erosion rates to some extent, higher levels of cohesion above 1,000 Pa may actually increase viscous erosion rates due to particle clumping. A modified version of Metzger's (2024a) equation for volumetric erosion rate is presented, with limitations discussed. These modified equations for viscous erosion, with limitations noted, show that geotechnical properties play an important role in viscous erosion and should be considered in PSI computer models for future mission planning.</description>

      <title>Generalized Runcorn's theorem and crustal magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the era of NASA's Apollo missions, Keith S. Runcorn proposed an explanation of discrepancy between the Moon's negligible global magnetic field and magnetized samples of lunar regolith, based on identical vanishing of external magnetic field of a spherical shell, magnetized by an internal source which is no longer present. We revisit and generalize the Runcorn's result, showing that it is a consequence of a (weighted) orthogonality of gradients of harmonic functions on a spherical shell in arbitrary number of dimensions. Furthermore, we explore bounds on external magnetic field in the case when the idealized spherical shell is replaced with a more realistic geometric shape and when the thermoremanent magnetization susceptibility deviates from the spherical symmetry. Finally, we analyse a model of thermoremanent magnetization acquired by crustal inward cooling of a spherical astrophysical body and put some general bounds on the associated magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Eulerian and Lagrangian electron energization during magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron energization by magnetic reconnection has historically been studied in the Lagrangian guiding-center framework. Insights from such studies include that Fermi acceleration in magnetic islands can accelerate electrons to high energies. An alternative Eulerian fluid formulation of electron energization was recently used to study electron energization during magnetic reconnection in the absence of magnetic islands. Here, we use particle-in-cell simulations to compare the Eulerian and Lagrangian models of electron energization in a setup where reconnection leads to magnetic island formation. We find the largest energization at the edges of magnetic islands. There, energization related to the diamagnetic drift dominates in the Eulerian model, while the Fermi related term dominates in the Lagrangian model. The models predict significantly different energization rates locally. A better agreement is found after integrating over the simulation domain. We show that strong magnetic curvature can break the magnetic moment conservation assumed by the Lagrangian model, leading to erroneous results. The Eulerian fluid model is a complete fluid description and accurately models bulk energization. However, local measurements of its constituent energization terms need not reflect locations where plasma is heated or accelerated. The Lagrangian guiding center model can accurately describe the energization of particles, but it cannot describe the evolution of the fluid energy. We conclude that while both models can be valid, they describe two fundamentally different quantities, and care should be taken when choosing which model to use.</description>
