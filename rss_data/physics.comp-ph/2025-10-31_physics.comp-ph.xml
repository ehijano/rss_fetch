      <title>Equation Discovery, Parametric Simulation, and Optimization Using the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) Method for the Heat Conduction Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the capabilities of the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) method are investigated for three major tasks: modeling, simulation, and optimization in the context of the heat conduction problem. In the modeling phase, the governing equation of heat transfer by conduction is reconstructed through equation discovery using fractional-order derivatives, enabling the identification of the fractional derivative order that best describes the physical behavior. In the simulation phase, the thermal conductivity is treated as a physical parameter, and a parametric simulation is performed to analyze its influence on the temperature field. In the optimization phase, the focus is placed on the inverse problem, where the goal is to infer unknown physical properties from observed data. The effectiveness of the PINN approach is evaluated across these three fundamental engineering problem types and compared against conventional numerical methods. The results demonstrate that although PINNs may not yet outperform traditional numerical solvers in terms of speed and accuracy for forward problems, they offer a powerful and flexible framework for parametric simulation, optimization, and equation discovery, making them highly valuable for inverse and data-driven modeling applications.</description>

      <title>Generative Artificial Intelligence for Air Shower Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detailed simulation of extensive air showers, produced by primary cosmic rays interacting in the atmosphere, is a task that is traditionally undertaken by means of Monte Carlo methods. These processes are computationally intensive, accounting for a major fraction of the computational resources used in the large-scale simulations required by current and future experiments in the field of astroparticle physics. In this work, we present a novel approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to accelerate air shower simulations. We developed and trained a GAN on a dataset of high-energy proton-induced air showers generated with \texttt{CORSIKA}; our model reproduces key distributions of secondary particles, such as energy spectra and spatial distributions at ground level of muons. Once the model has been trained, which takes approximately 74 hours, the generation real time per shower is reduced by a factor of $10^4$ with respect to the full \texttt{CORSIKA} simulation, leading to a substantial decrease in both computational time and energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Patch-MLP-Based Predictive Control: Simulation of Upstream Pointing Stabilization for PHELIX Laser System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy laser facilities such as PHELIX at GSI require excellent beam pointing stability for reproducibility and relative independence for future experiments. Beam pointing stability has been traditionally achieved using simple proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control which removes the problem of slow drift, but is limited because of the time delay in knowing the diagnosis and the inertia in the mechanical system associated with mirrors. In this work, we introduce a predictive control strategy where the forecasting of beam pointing errors is performed by a patch-based multilayer perceptron (Patch-MLP) designed to capture local temporal patterns for more robust short-term jitter prediction. The subsequent conversion of these predicted errors into correction signals is handled by a PID controller. The neural network has been trained on diagnostic time-series data to predict beam pointing error. Using the feed-forward controller compensates for system delays. Simulations with a correction mirror placed upstream of the PHELIX pre-amplifier bridge confirm that the predictive control scheme reduces residual jitter compared to conventional PID control. Over a 10-hour dataset the controller maintained stable performance without drift, while standard pointing metrics showed consistent improvements of the order of 10 to 20 percent. The predictive controller operates without drift, and therefore may improve reproducibility and operational efficiency in high energy, low repetition rate laser experiment conditions.</description>

      <title>Geometric and Orbital Control of Correlated States in Small Hubbard Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arrays of semiconductor quantum dots provide a powerful platform to design correlated quantum matter from the bottom up. We establish a predictive framework for engineering local electron pairing in these artificial molecules by systematically deploying three control levers: lattice geometry, orbital hybridization, and external electric fields. Using Hartree-Fock simulations on canonical 3D clusters from the tetrahedron (Z = 3) to the FCC lattice (Z = 12), at and near half-filling, we uncover three fundamental design principles. (i) Geometric Hierarchy: The resilience to Coulomb repulsion U is dictated by the coordination number Z, which controls kinetic delocalization. (ii) Orbital Hybridization: Counter-intuitively, inter-orbital hopping t_orb acts not as a simple suppressor of pairing, but as a sophisticated control knob that enhances double occupancy at moderate U by engineering the on-site energy landscape. (iii) Field Squeezing: An electric field robustly induces pairing by forcing charge localization, an effect most potent in low-connectivity clusters. These principles form a blueprint for deterministically targeting charge and spin correlations in quantum-dot-based quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Exciton dynamics in equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bound electron-hole pairs known as excitons govern the optical properties of insulating solids. While their behavior in equilibrium is well-understood theoretically, the nonequilibrium regime at high excitation densities-where phenomena like electron-hole liquids emerge - is less explored. This thesis presents a first-principles study of excitons in two-dimensional materials. We use the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation to investigate their properties from equilibrium to nonequilibrium conditions. We first demonstrate how increasing photo-excited carrier density leads to a redshift-blueshift crossover of excitons. We then show that electron-phonon interactions critically modify optical spectra and exciton lifetimes at finite temperatures. Finally, we unify these effects to demonstrate the formation of an electron-hole liquid phase above a critical carrier density and below a critical temperature. Our work identifies how enhanced Coulomb interactions in two dimensions can stabilize this phase at significantly higher temperatures, proposing promising material candidates for observing these collective states.</description>

      <title>Accelerated decomposition of bistochastic kernel matrices by low rank approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an accelerated algorithm for computing an approximate eigenvalue decomposition of bistochastic normalized kernel matrices. Our approach constructs a low rank approximation of the original kernel matrix by the pivoted partial Cholesky algorithm and uses it to compute an approximate decomposition of its bistochastic normalization without requiring the formation of the full kernel matrix. The cost of the proposed algorithm depends linearly on the size of the employed training dataset and quadratically on the rank of the low rank approximation, offering a significant cost reduction compared to the naive approach. We apply the proposed algorithm to the kernel based extraction of spatiotemporal patterns from chaotic dynamics, demonstrating its accuracy while also comparing it with an alternative algorithm consisting of subsampling and Nystroem extension.</description>

      <title>Generative sampling with physics-informed kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a generative network for Monte-Carlo sampling in lattice field theories and beyond, for which the learning of layerwise propagation is done and optimised independently on each layer. The architecture uses physics-informed renormalisation group flows that provide access to the layerwise propagation step from one layer to the next in terms of a simple first order partial differential equation for the respective renormalisation group kernel through a given layer. Thus, it transforms the generative task into that of solving once the set of independent and linear differential equations for the kernels of the transformation. As these equations are analytically known, the kernels can be refined iteratively. This allows us to structurally tackle out-of-domain problems generally encountered in generative models and opens the path to further optimisation. We illustrate the practical feasibility of the architecture within simulations in scalar field theories.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependent ferroelectricity in strained KTaO3 with machine learned force field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials are a class of dielectrics that exhibit spontaneous polarization which can be reversed under an external electric field. The emergence of ferroelectric order in incipient ferroelectrics is a topic of considerable interest from both fundamental and applied perspectives. Among the various strategies explored, strain engineering has been proven to be a powerful method for tuning ferroelectric polarization in materials. In the case of KTaO3, first principles calculations have suggested that strain can drive a ferroelectric phase transition. In this study, we investigate the impact of in-plane uniaxial and biaxial strain, ranging from 0% to 1%, on pristine KTaO3 to explore its potential for ferroelectricity induction via inversion symmetry breaking. By integrating density functional theory calculations with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation assisted by on the fly machine learned force field, we obtain accurate structural information and dynamical properties under varying strain conditions while incorporating higher-order anharmonic effects. Employing the Berry phase method, we obtained the ferroelectric polarization of the strained structures over the entire temperature range up to 300 K. Our findings provide valuable insights into the role of strain in stabilizing ferroelectricity in KTaO3, offering guidance for future experimental and theoretical studies on strain-engineered ferroelectric materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe how quantum Monte Carlo calculations using the CASINO software can be accelerated using graphics processing units (GPUs) and OpenACC. In particular we consider offloading Ewald summation, the evaluation of long-range two-body terms in the Jastrow correlation factor, and the evaluation of orbitals in a blip basis set. We present results for three- and two-dimensional homogeneous electron gases and ab initio simulations of bulk materials, showing that significant speedups of up to a factor of 2.5 can be achieved by the use of GPUs when several hundred particles are included in the simulations. The use of single-precision arithmetic can improve the speedup further without significant detriment to the accuracy of the calculations.</description>

      <title>The dawn of alchemical free-energy methods in biomolecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04917v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the onset of fundamental statistical mechanical constructs formulated in the late 19th century, alchemical free-energy methods slowly emerged and transitioned to become operational tools of biomolecular simulation applicable to a wide range of problems including protein-ligand binding for drug discovery research. This article reconstructs how statistical mechanical approaches such as thermodynamic integration and free-energy perturbation were reconfigured in the early 1980's to address the complexities of increasingly heterogeneous biomolecular systems. Drawing on oral history interviews and primary literature, the study examines the technical, institutional, theoretical, and infrastructural conditions under which these methods were implemented, and became progressively operational. These conditions encompassed the consolidation of lab-specific software infrastructures, the formulation of practical simulation protocols, as well as essential statistical mechanical clarifications. From this perspective, the progress of free-energy methods proceeded less from a unified convergence than from an iterative troubleshooting process of alignment involving practical and theoretical considerations. The aim of the present article is to offer a historically grounded account of how free-energy techniques acquired practical and functional reliability.</description>

      <title>Monte-Carlo/Moments micro-macro Parareal method for unimodal and bimodal scalar McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a micro-macro parallel-in-time Parareal method for scalar McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In the algorithm, the fine Parareal propagator is a Monte Carlo simulation of an ensemble of particles, while an approximate ordinary differential equation (ODE) description of the mean and the variance of the particle distribution is used as a coarse Parareal propagator to achieve speedup. We analyse the convergence behaviour of our method for a linear problem and provide numerical experiments indicating the parallel weak scaling of the algorithm on a set of examples. We show, with numerical experiments, that convergence typically takes place in a low number of iterations, depending on the quality of the ODE predictor. For bimodal SDEs, we avoid quality deterioration of the coarse predictor (compared to unimodal SDEs) through the usage of multiple ODEs, each describing the mean and variance of the particle distribution in locally unimodal regions of the phase space. The benefit of the proposed algorithm can be viewed through two lenses: (i) through the parallel-in-time lens, speedup is obtained through the use of a very cheap coarse integrator (an ODE moment model), and (ii) through the moment models lens, accuracy is iteratively gained through the use of parallel machinery as a corrector. In contrast to the isolated use of a moment model, the proposed method (iteratively) converges to the true distribution generated by the SDE.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Programming for Differential Equations: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The differentiable programming paradigm is a cornerstone of modern scientific computing. It refers to numerical methods for computing the gradient of a numerical model's output. Many scientific models are based on differential equations, where differentiable programming plays a crucial role in calculating model sensitivities, inverting model parameters, and training hybrid models that combine differential equations with data-driven approaches. Furthermore, recognizing the strong synergies between inverse methods and machine learning offers the opportunity to establish a coherent framework applicable to both fields. Differentiating functions based on the numerical solution of differential equations is non-trivial. Numerous methods based on a wide variety of paradigms have been proposed in the literature, each with pros and cons specific to the type of problem investigated. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques to compute derivatives of numerical solutions of differential equations. We first discuss the importance of gradients of solutions of differential equations in a variety of scientific domains. Second, we lay out the mathematical foundations of the various approaches and compare them with each other. Third, we cover the computational considerations and explore the solutions available in modern scientific software. Last but not least, we provide best-practices and recommendations for practitioners. We hope that this work accelerates the fusion of scientific models and data, and fosters a modern approach to scientific modelling.</description>

      <title>Reducing Weighted Ensemble Variance With Optimal Trajectory Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weighted ensemble (WE) is an enhanced path-sampling method that is conceptually simple, widely applicable, and statistically exact. In a WE simulation, an ensemble of trajectories is periodically pruned or replicated to enhance sampling of rare transitions and improve estimation of mean first passage times (MFPTs). However, poor choices of the parameters governing pruning and replication can lead to high-variance MFPT estimates. Our previous work [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 014108 (2023)] presented an optimal WE parameterization strategy and applied it in low-dimensional example systems. The strategy harnesses estimated local MFPTs from different initial configurations to a single target state. In the present work, we apply the optimal parameterization strategy to more challenging, high-dimensional molecular models, namely, synthetic molecular dynamics (MD) models of Trp-cage folding and unfolding, as well as atomistic MD models of NTL9 folding in high-friction and low-friction continuum solvents. In each system we use WE to estimate the MFPT for folding or unfolding events. We show that the optimal parameterization reduces the variance of MFPT estimates in three of four systems, with dramatic improvement in the most challenging atomistic system. Overall, the parameterization strategy improves the accuracy and reliability of WE estimates for the kinetics of biophysical processes.</description>
