      <title>Color confinement due to spontaneous breaking of magnetic $U(1)_m^8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity is equal to 8 Abelian monopole currents of the Dirac type satisfying Abelian conservation rules kinematically. There exist magnetic $U(1)_m^8$ symmetries in non-Abelian $SU(3)$ QCD. When the magnetic $U(1)_m^8$ symmetries are broken spontaneously, only states which are invariant under all $U(1)_e$ subgroups of $SU(3)$ can exist as a physical state. Such states are $SU(3)$ singlets. The QCD vacuum in the confinement phase is characterized by one long percolating monopole loop running over the whole lattice volume in both quenched and full QCD. The long loop in full QCD is on average a few times longer in comparison with that in quenched QCD case. Surprisingly, the monopole behaviors in full QCD seem independent of the bare quark mass suggesting irrelevance of Abelian monopoles to the chiral symmetry breaking mechanism.
  Existence of such Abelian magnetic monopoles in the continuum limit is studied in detail in $SU(3)$ by means of a block spin transformation of monopoles and the inverse Monte-Carlo method. The monopole density $\rho$ and the infrared effective monopole action $S(k)$ of $n$ blocked monopoles are determined for $a(\beta)=(0.04\sim 2)$fm and $n=1\sim 12$ blockings on $48^4$ lattice in quenched QCD and for $a(\beta)=0.0846(7)$fm and $n=1\sim 24$ on $96^4$ in full QCD at $m_\pi=146$MeV. Originally $\rho$ and $S(k)$ are a two-point function of $a(\beta)$ and the number of times of the blocking transformation $n$. However, both are found to be a function of $b=na(\beta)$ alone in the quenched QCD which suggests the existence of the continuum limit. In the full QCD, the renormalization flow is observed similarly but the scaling is not yet proved. The distributions of the long loops show that monopole condensation occurs due to the entropy dominance over the energy for all $b$ considered.</description>

      <title>Action of the axial $U(1)$ non-invertible symmetry on the 't~Hooft line operator: A simple argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing the modified Villain lattice formulation of the axion QED, we present an alternative and much simpler derivation of the conclusion of~Ref.~\cite{Honda:2024sdz} that the sweep of the axial $U(1)$ non-invertible symmetry operator over the (non-genuine) gauge invariant 't~Hooft line operator with an integer magnetic charge does not leave any effect. The point is that such a 't~Hooft line can be represented by a boundary of a (non-topological) defect that is invariant under the axial transformation on the axion field.</description>

      <title>Valence Quark PDFs of the Proton from Two-Current Correlations in Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following previous works on that topic, we consider Euclidean hadronic matrix elements in position space of two spatially separated local currents on the lattice, in order to extract the $x$-dependence of parton distribution functions (PDFs). The corresponding approach is often referred to by the term lattice cross section (LCS). In this work we will consider valence quark PDFs of an unpolarized proton. We adapt the previously established formalism to our choice of operators. The calculation of the two-current matrix elements requires the evaluation of four-point functions. The corresponding calculation is carried out on a $n_f = 2+1$ gauge ensemble with lattice spacing $a = 0.0856~\mathrm{fm}$ and pseudoscalar masses $m_\pi = 355~\mathrm{MeV}$, $m_K = 441~\mathrm{MeV}$. The four-point functions have been evaluated in a previous project. The lattice data is converted to the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$-scheme at a scale $\mu=2~\mathrm{GeV}$ and improved w.r.t. lattice artifacts. We use a common model as fit ansatz for the lattice data in order to extract the PDFs.</description>

      <title>Disentangling new physics in $K\rightarrow\pi\bar{\nu}\nu$ and $B\rightarrow K(K^*)\bar{\nu}\nu$ observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of disentangling different new physics contributions to the rare meson decays $K\rightarrow\pi+\displaystyle{\not}E$ and $B\rightarrow K(K^*)+\displaystyle{\not}E$ through kinematic distributions in the missing energy $\displaystyle{\not}E$. We employ dimension-$6$ operators within the Low-Energy Effective Field Theory (LEFT), identifying the invisible part of the final state as either active or sterile neutrinos. Special emphasis is given to lepton-number violating (LNV) operators with scalar and tensor currents. We show analytically that contributions from scalar, vector, and tensor quark currents can be uniquely determined from experimental data of kinematic distributions. In addition, we present new correlations of branching ratios for $K$ and $B$-decays involving scalar and tensor currents. As there could a priori also be new invisible particles in the final states, we include dark-sector operators giving rise to two dark scalars, fermions, or vectors in the final state. In this context, we present new calculations of the inclusive decay rate $B\rightarrow X_s+\displaystyle{\not}E$ for dark operators. We show that careful measurements of kinematic distributions make it theoretically possible to disentangle the contribution from LEFT operators from most of the dark-sector operators, even when multiple operators are contributing. We revisit sum rules for vector currents in LEFT and show that the latter are also satisfied in some new dark-physics scenarios that could mimic LEFT. Finally, we point out that an excess in rare meson decays consistent with a LNV hypothesis would point towards highly flavor non-democratic physics in the UV, and could put high-scale leptogenesis under tension.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Structure of Hidden-Bottom Strange Pentaquarks via Magnetic Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of hidden-charm strange pentaquarks, we conduct a systematic study of the magnetic moments of the hidden-bottom strange pentaquarks in molecular picture. We calculate magnetic moments of hidden-bottom strange pentaquarks with strangeness-1 and 2. Magnetic moment gives valuable information about the inner structure and shape of the hadron. The obtained results may be helpful to determine the inner structure of these new yet hypothetical states.</description>

      <title>Investigation on the electromagnetic properties of the $ D^{(*)} \Sigma_c^{(*)}$ molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically explore their electromagnetic characteristics to improve our understanding of the quark-gluon dynamics underlying the complex and controversial nature of multiquark systems. In this study, the magnetic dipole moments of $ D \Sigma_c$, $ D \Sigma_c^{*}$ and $ D^{*} \Sigma_c$ doubly-charmed pentaquarks are extracted, which are directly related to the inner organization of the relevant states. The magnetic dipole moments of these states have been evaluated employing the QCD light-cone sum rules technique with isospin spin-parity $\rm{I(J^P)} = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2}^-)$, $\rm{I(J^P)} = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{3}{2}^-)$ and $\rm{I(J^P)} = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{3}{2}^-)$, for $ D \Sigma_c$, $ D \Sigma_c^{*}$ and $ D^{*} \Sigma_c$ doubly-charmed pentaquarks respectively. Our predictions for the magnetic dipole moment $\mu_{D\Sigma_c} = 2.98^{+0.76}_{-0.54}~\mu_N$ for the $ D \Sigma_c$ pentaquark, $\mu_{D\Sigma_c^*} = 1.65^{+0.45}_{-0.34}~\mu_N$ for the $D\Sigma_c^*$ pentaquark, and $\mu_{D^*\Sigma_c} = -3.63^{+0.79}_{-0.60}~\mu_N$ for the $D^*\Sigma_c$ pentaquark. Furthermore, we have also extracted the electric quadrupole and the magnetic octupole moments of the $ D \Sigma_c^{*}$ and $ D^{*} \Sigma_c$ doubly-charmed pentaquarks. These values show a non-spherical charge distribution. As a by-product, the magnetic dipole moments of the isospin-$\frac{3}{2}$ partners associated with these doubly-charmed pentaquarks have also been determined. The magnetic dipole moments are calculated as follows: $\mu_{D\Sigma_c} = 3.78^{+0.94}_{-0.70}~\mu_N$, $ \mu_{D\Sigma_c^*} = 2.08^{+0.57}_{-0.43}~\mu_N$, $\mu_{D^*\Sigma_c} = -4.59^{+0.99}_{-0.76}~\mu_N$ for the isospin-$\frac{3}{2}$ partners $ D \Sigma_c$, $ D \Sigma_c^{*}$ and $ D^{*} \Sigma_c$ doubly-charmed pentaquarks, respectively.</description>

      <title>Pole trajectories of the $\Lambda(1405)$ helps establish its dynamical nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral trajectories of dynamically generated resonances are connected to the SU(3) breaking pattern and their nature. From an analysis of a recent LQCD simulation on the $\pi\Sigma-\bar{K}N$ scattering for $I=0$, and the study of the quark mass dependence of the octet baryons, we determine for the first time the trajectory of the two poles associated to the $\Lambda(1405)$ towards the symmetric point $(\mathrm{Tr}[M]=\mathrm{cte})$ accurately. Our result at unphysical pion mass is consistent with the lattice simulation at $m_\pi\simeq 200$ MeV and the extrapolation to the physical point, based on the NLO chiral lagrangian, agrees perfectly well with previous analyses of experimental data. Contrary to other works, we predict qualitatively similar trajectories at LO and up to NLO, being consistent with the dominance of the LO interaction. At the SU(3) symmetric point up to NLO, we obtain that the lower pole is located at $E^{(1)}=1595\pm8$ MeV, being a singlet representation, while the higher pole belongs to the octet with a mass $E^{(8)}=1600\pm4$ MeV. This can be tested in the future LQCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Infrared gluon propagator in the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger scenario at one-loop order in the Landau gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Refined Gribov-Zwanziger (RGZ) action in the Landau gauge provides a local and renormalizable framework to account for the existence of infinitesimal Gribov copies in the path integral together with other relevant infrared effects such as the formation of condensates. The properties of the tree-level gluon propagator obtained in this setup has been thoroughly investigated over the past decade. It accommodates important properties seen in lattice simulations such as a finite value at vanishing momentum and positivity violation. Yet a comprehensive study about the stability of such properties against quantum corrections was lacking. In this work, we compute the gluon propagator in the RGZ scenario at one-loop order and implement an appropriate renormalization scheme in order to compare our findings with lattice data. Remarkably, the qualitative properties of the tree-level gluon propagator are preserved. In particular, the fits with lattice data show evidence for positivity violation and the existence of complex poles for SU(2) and SU(3) gauge groups. We comment on the results for the ghost propagator as well.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the pion and meson dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the recent MIT lattice QCD data for the pion's gravitational form factors are, in the covered momentum transfer range, fully consistent with the meson dominance principle. In particular, the $2^{++}$ component can be accurately saturated with the $f_2(1270)$ meson, whereas the $0^{++}$ component with the $\sigma$ meson. To incorporate the large width of the $\sigma$, we use the dispersion relation with the spectral density obtained from the analysis of the physical pion scattering data by Donoghue, Gasser, and Leutwyler. We also discuss the implications of the perturbative QCD constraints at high momentum transfers, leading to specific sum rules for the spectral densities of the gravitational form factors, and argue that these densities cannot be of definite sign.</description>

      <title>QCD Equation of State at nonzero baryon density in external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of QCD equation of state in external magnetic field and nonzero baryon density. Our study is carried out by means of lattice simulation with 2+1 dynamical staggered quarks at the physical masses. The simulation is conducted at imaginary baryon chemical potential what allowed us to overcome the sign problem. We expand the pressure in the baryon imaginary chemical potential and study three leading nonzero coefficients in this expansion. These coefficients were calculated for the following values of magnetic field: $eB=0.3$, $0.6$, $1.2$ GeV$^2$ with the lattice sizes $8\times32^3$, $10\times40^3$, $12\times48^3$. Using these data we take continuum limit for the coefficients. Our results indicate considerable enhancement of the expansion coefficients by the magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the contribution of color correlations to Double Parton Scattering (DPS). We show that there is a specific class of Feynman diagrams related to so called 1 \textrightarrow{} 2 processes when the contribution of these color correlations is not Sudakov suppressed with the transverse scales. The split scale increases with the transverse scale Q, with color correlations being up to 5-10 percent of singlet ones. The effective absence of Sudakov suppression gives hope that although they are small relative to color singlet correlations, they eventually can be observed.</description>

      <title>Calculation of SU(2) string tension in the continuum limit by an effective theory of center vortices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an effective theory for an ensemble of center vortices, we observe the area law fall-off in the continuum limit for the SU($2$) gauge group in three-dimensional Euclidean space-time. The string tension is obtained in terms of the intrinsic properties of the vortices and the parameter describing their interactions. A good qualitative agreement between our results and the lattice ones is observed. In addition, we show that the repulsive force between the vortices increases with temperature. This behavior is expected due to the reduction of vortex configuration at higher temperatures, required for the deconfinement regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the triply heavy spin-1/2 baryons with quark contents $ ccb $ and $ bbc $, and calculate their mass and residue using QCD sum rules. In the calculations, we consider the ground (1S), first orbitally excited (1P) and first radially excited (2S) states. Aiming to achieve higher accuracies in the results, we perform the computations by taking into account the non-perturbative operators up to eight mass dimensions. We compare our results with the predictions of other theoretical studies existing in the literature. The obtained results may help experimental groups in their search for these yet unseen, but previously predicted by the quark model, interesting particles.</description>
