      <title>Topological Social Choice: Designing a Noise-Robust Polar Distance for Persistence Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has emerged as a powerful framework for extracting robust and interpretable features from noisy high-dimensional data. In the context of Social Choice Theory, where preference profiles and collective decisions are geometrically rich yet sensitive to perturbations, TDA remains largely unexplored. This work introduces a novel conceptual bridge between these domains by proposing a new metric framework for persistence diagrams tailored to noisy preference data.We define a polar coordinate-based distance that captures both the magnitude and orientation of topological features in a smooth and differentiable manner. Our metric addresses key limitations of classical distances, such as bottleneck and Wasserstein, including instability under perturbation, lack of continuity, and incompatibility with gradient-based learning. The resulting formulation offers improved behavior in both theoretical and applied settings.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically apply persistent homology to social choice systems, providing a mathematically grounded method for comparing topological summaries of voting structures and preference dynamics. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach through extensive experiments, including robustness tests and supervised learning tasks, and we propose a modular pipeline for building predictive models from online preference data. This work contributes a conceptually novel and computationally effective tool to the emerging interface of topology and decision theory, opening new directions in interpretable machine learning for political and economic systems.</description>

      <title>Lectures on bar and cobar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss Lurie's (derived) bar and cobar constructions, the classical ones for simplicial groups and sets (due to Eilenberg-MacLane and Kan), and the classical ones for differential graded (co)algebras (due to Eilenberg-MacLane and Adams) and their relations, putting them into an abstract framework which makes sense much more generally for any cofibration of infinity-operads. Along these lines we give new and rather conceptual existence proofs of Lurie's adjunction (where bar is left adjoint) and the classical adjunction (where bar is right adjoint). We also recover various classical comparison maps, e.g. the Szczarba and Hess-Tonks maps comparing Adams cobar with Kan's loop group.</description>

      <title>Massey products for homotopy inner products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper defines Massey-type products for a homotopy inner product on an $A_\infty$ algebra, called Massey inner products. We include an explicit description of ordinary Massey products for $A_\infty$ algebras, and for $A_\infty$ modules, and show that Massey product sets can have interesting internal structure. We give non-trivial applications from lens spaces, links, and low dimensional manifolds, showing Massey inner products contain information beyond ordinary Massey products.</description>

      <title>On the computation of $\mathrm{Ext}_{\mathcal A}^{k,k+*}(\mathbb{Z}/2,\mathbb{Z}/2)$ for $k \leq 5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Note presents a computational algorithm for determining a basis of the cohomology of the mod 2 Steenrod algebra, $\mathrm{Ext}_{\mathcal A}^{k, k+*}(\mathbb{Z}/2, \mathbb{Z}/2)$ for $k \leq 5$, based on the well-known generators and the Adem relations given in Chen's work [2]. The purpose of this algorithm is to verify the hand-computed results for $\mathrm{Ext}_{\mathcal A}^{4, 4+*}(\mathbb{Z}/2, \mathbb{Z}/2)$ presented in our corrected papers [8, 9, 10]. Combining our most recent works [11, 12], the verification of the domain and the codomain of the fourth algebraic transfer in specific degrees can now be completed.</description>

      <title>The configuration functor of a punctured space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $U$ be a space whose one point compactification $U^*$ is a CW-complex for which the added point $*$ is the only $0$-cell. We observe that the configuration space $Conf_n(U)$ of $n$ numbered distinct points in $U$ has no closed support homology in degree $&lt;n$ and prove that Borel-Moore homology group $H^{cl}_n(Conf_n(U))$ depends only on the fundamental group $\pi_1(U^*,*)$. We describe this homology group in terms of a presentation of $\pi_1(U^*,*)$.
  A case of interest is when $U$ is a connected closed oriented surface of positive genus minus a finite nonempty set. Then the mapping class group $Mod(U)$ of $U$ acts on both $\pi_1(U^*,*)$ and ${H^k}(Conf_n(U){)}\cong H^{cl}_ {2n-k}(Conf_n(U))$ and we prove that its action on the latter is through its action on the nilpotent quotient $\pi_1(U^*,*)/ \pi_1(U^*,*)^{(k+1)}$. Furthermore, we give an example of a mapping class of a once punctured closed surface $U$ which acts trivially on ${H^n}(Conf_n(U))$, but not on the nilpotent quotient $\pi_1(U^*,*)/ \pi_1(U^*,*)^{(n+1)}$. The former generalizes a theorem of Bianchi-Miller-Wilson and the latter disproves a conjecture of theirs.</description>

      <title>On the subdirect product of graph bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The subdirect product of two finite groups $A$ and $B$ is defined as a subgroup of the direct product $A \times B$, which is a well-known notion in finite group theory. While it is clear that, under appropriate choices of sets of generators $S$, $S_A$ and $S_B$, the Cayley graph $Cay(A \times B, S)$ corresponds to the Cartesian product $Cay(A, S_A) \square Cay(B, S_B)$ of two graphs, there is no analogue at the level of graph product that reflects the notion of subdirect product of groups. This is precisely the problem which we discuss here. By using the concept of graph bundles and the corresponding pullbacks, we introduce an operation on graph bundles such that the Cayley graph of the subdirect product of two groups can be described as the total space of the product of the Cayley graphs. This allows us to define the so-called ``network $K$-theory group of a graph'', inspired by the notion of topological $K$-theory, and we are able to investigate an interesting functor from the category of graphs to the category of abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter persistence modules in the large scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A persistence module with $m$ discrete parameters is a diagram of vector spaces indexed by the poset $\mathbb{N}^m$. If we are only interested in the large scale behavior of such a diagram, then we can consider two diagrams equivalent if they agree outside of a ``negligeable'' region. In the $2$-dimensional case, we classify the indecomposable diagrams up to finitely supported diagrams. In higher dimension, we partially classify the indecomposable diagrams up to suitably finite diagrams, and show that the full classification problem is wild.</description>

      <title>Weyl group symmetries of the toric variety associated with Weyl chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any crystallographic root system, let $W$ be the associated Weyl group, and let $\mathit{WP}$ be the weight polytope (also known as the $W$-permutohedron) associated with an arbitrary strongly dominant weight. The action of $W$ on $\mathit{WP}$ induces an action on the toric variety $X(\mathit{WP})$ associated with the normal fan of $\mathit{WP}$, and hence an action on the rational cohomology ring $H^*\left(X(\mathit{WP})\right)$. Let $P$ be the corresponding dominant weight polytope, which is a fundamental region of the $W$-action on $\mathit{WP}$. We give a type uniform algebraic proof that the fixed subring $H^*\left(X(\mathit{WP})\right)^{W}$ is isomorphic to the cohomology ring $H^*\left(X(P)\right)$ of the toric variety $X(P)$ associated with the normal fan of $P$. Notably, our proof applies to all finite (not necessarily crystallographic) Coxeter groups, answering a question of Horiguchi--Masuda--Shareshian--Song about non-crystallographic root systems.</description>

      <title>Lie algebra homology with coefficients tensor products of the adjoint representation in relative polynomial degree 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The homology of free Lie algebras with coefficients in tensor products of the adjoint representation working over Q contains important information on the homological properties of polynomial outer functors on free groups. The latter category was introduced in joint work with Vespa, motivated by the study of higher Hochschild homology of wedges of circles.
  There is a splitting of this homology by polynomial degree (for polynomiality with respect to the generators of the free Lie algebra) and one can consider the polynomial degree relative to the number of tensor factors in the coefficients. It suffices to consider the Lie algebra homology in homological degree one; this vanishes in relative degree 0 and is readily calculated in relative degree 1.
  This paper calculates the homology in relative degree 2, which presents interesting features. This confirms a conjecture of Gadish and Hainaut.</description>

      <title>The universal Euler characteristic and Burnside group for definable groupoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the universal Euler characteristic of orbit space definable groupoids, a class of groupoids containing cocompact proper Lie groupoids as well as translation groupoids associated to proper definable group actions. We show that every additive and multiplicative invariant of orbit space definable groupoids with an additional local triviality hypothesis arises as a ring homomorphism applied to the universal Euler characteristic. This in particular includes the $\Gamma$-orbifold Euler characteristic introduced by the first and third authors when $\Gamma$ is a finitely presented group.
  For definable groupoids, where the object and arrow spaces as well as the structure maps are definable, we also introduce a Burnside group (which admits a partial multiplication), which generalizes the classical Burnside ring associated to compact Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Cartesian subgroups in graph products of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kernel of the natural projection of a graph product of groups onto their direct product is called the Cartesian subgroup of the graph product. This construction generalises commutator subgroups of right-angled Coxeter and Artin groups. Using theory of polyhedral products, we give a lower and an upper bound on the number of relations in presentations of Cartesian groups and on their deficiency. The bounds are related to the fundamental groups of full subcomplexes in the clique complex, and the lower bound coincide with the upper bound if these fundamental groups are free or free abelian.
  Following Li Cai's approach, we also describe an algorithm that computes "small" presentations of Cartesian subgroups.</description>
